Thanks for reading all of this, even if you didn't read all of this, and your eye started somewhere else have a cookie.

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine human-written attempt at an answer.

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Accounts using AI to generate answers will be banned. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed. (Link only responses are permitted if they are asking for a subreddit.)

Do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should "google it." Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself.

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Be Nice

Follow Reddiquette:  Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

#Rule 4: No medical advice questions

No medical advice questions

A rule of thumb would be: Could this question or its answers make someone decide not to go see a doctor when they really should?

If you are asking here to avoid bothering a doctor, you probably should bother a doctor.

#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions

Disallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc. 

#Rule 6: No suicide or 'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?' questions

Suicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging

No trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question. 

Asking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that. 

No questions trying to elicit participation without learning anything of substance from the answers.

#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter

Nothing like "Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics

Questions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.

We are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large. We reserve the right to make judgement calls on when a particular thread becomes disruptive to the sub, and we are unable to maintain a civil space for the discussion.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).

#SUBREDDIT RULES:

## Rule 1: Poor Behavior

This sub has a zero tolerance policy against bigotry (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc) of any sort. Slurs or extreme insults are not okay. No toxicity or arguing either - this is meant to be a fun community. Just be excellent to each other.

## Rule 2: Recently posted jokes

If you see a recent post containing the joke you want explained, use that to find the punchline instead. Simple as that.
 
We define "recently posted joke" as anything that's been posted within the last three months.

Overused memes such as Loss and unedited Stonetoss comics are banned.

## Rule 3: Dogwhistles/Conspiracy Theories

We have a zero tolerance policy for dogwhistling of any kind. Dogwhistling are bigoted terms only people in that bigoted group would understand (Ex. 88 for Heil Hitler.) If the punchline of a joke is something bigoted the post will be removed for dogwhistling.

Try not to spread conspiracy theories either (pandemic denial, genocide apologism, etc).

Intentionally posting content with the goal of spreading bigotry or conspiracy theories will result in a ban.

## Rule 4: Political Shilling / Debating

Political posts ARE allowed so long as they are jokes that need to be explained and are posted in good-faith. This is NOT a debate sub. Do not argue politics in the comments.

## Rule 5: 'Wooooshing' users

An obvious punchline to you isn't necessarily obvious to others. This is a community for everyone to have jokes explained without judgment - try not to be rude.

If you have a history of whooshing here you will be banned.

Posts or memes whooshing users will result in an immediate ban.

## Rule 6: Low effort posts

If your post doesn't contain a joke needing explanation, it'll be removed.

You need to reply to the AutoMod comment with your best guess on what a meme means. If you don't reply with your best guess your post will be removed.

Overall poor quality post will be removed.

If the content of the meme can be easily Googled the post will be removed.

If a joke is explained in the original thread being crossposted it will be removed.

## Rule 7: Banned Jokes

The following things are banned:

- [Unedited Stonetoss comics](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/stonetoss)

- [Loss memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/loss)

- [Man vs Bear memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/man-or-bear-in-the-woods-question)

- Jokes found in the stickied thread

These posts have become *extremely* repetitive and many of them incite vitriolic responses. If we add new things to this list, we will update it with a sticky post.

## Rule 8: Metaposts

Metaposts are allowed if in a joke format and relevant. Non-joke or irrelevant metaposts will be removed.

This rule does not apply to “weird pictures of Peter.”  Those are fine. 

## Rule 9: No bots, spam, machine-generated content, or karmafarming

Content posted by bots and spammers will be removed.

Machine generated content created by LLMs such as ChatGPT etc. will be removed.

Karmafarming is not allowed here. If we suspect your account of karmafarming it will be removed.

Posting jokes you already understood or any OC’s like self-made memes and comics will be counted as spam and removed.

Violating this rule could result in an immediate permanent ban.

**Official Subreddit of the PC Master Race** We're the largest community of PC enthusiasts on the Internet. [Begin your ascension today](//pcmasterrace.org/guide)!

#General Information

* Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
* Every kind of PC related content is welcome here. This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.
* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)
* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).
* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).
* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).

#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)

For an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).

* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).
* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.
* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.
* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.
* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.
* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: 
 - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).
 - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.
 - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.
 - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.
 - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).
 - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.
* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.
* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.
* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.
* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of "peasantry," including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).
* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.

* You learn something new every day; what did *you* learn today?
 
* Submit interesting and **specific facts** that you just found out (not broad information you looked up, TodayILearned is not [/r/wikipedia](/r/wikipedia)).
 
#Posting rules#
 
1. **Submissions must be verifiable**. *Please link directly to a reliable source that supports every claim in your post title.* **Images alone do not count as valid references.** Videos are fine so long as they come from reputable sources (e.g. BBC, Discovery, etc).
1. **No personal opinions, anecdotes or subjective statements** (e.g "TIL xyz is a great movie").

1. **No recent sources.** Any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) with a publication date more recent than two months are not allowed.
 
1. No politics, soapboxing, or agenda based submissions. This includes (but is not limited to) submissions related to: 
   1. Recent political issues and politicians
   1. Social and economic issues (including race/religion/gender)
   1. Environmental issues
   1. Police misconduct
 
1. **No misleading claims**. Posts that omit essential information, or present unrelated facts in a way that suggest a connection will be removed.
 
1. *Rephrase your post title if the following are not met:*
   1. Titles **must** begin with "TIL ..."
   1. Make them **descriptive, concise and specific** (e.g. not "TIL something interesting about bacon").
   1. Titles must be able to **stand on their own** without requiring readers to click on a link. Starting your title with a why/what/who/where/how modifier should be unnecessary.
   1. *"TIL about ..." and other broad posts don't belong on TIL. Try /r/Wikipedia, etc. instead, or be more specific (and avoid the word "about").*
   1. *"TIL how to ..." posts belong on* **/r/HowTo.**
   1. *"TIL the definition of a word..." Word definitions/translations/origins are not appropriate here*

1. No submissions related to the usage, existence or features of specific software/websites (e.g. "TIL you can click on widgets in WidgetMaker 1.22").

1.  **All NSFW links must be tagged** *(including comments).*
####  *Please see the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index) for more detailed explanations of the rules, as well as additional rules that may not be listed here*

#Frequent TILs Repost List#
As of January 2025

* This [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/wiki/index#wiki_frequent_tils_repost_list) was compiled from /r/todayilearned community [suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/4dnulc/request_for_identification_of_frequent_tils/?sort=top) by its members. If your TIL is found on this list, it will be removed. The titles have been abridged for the sake of brevity, however the context remains the same. This list is subject to change.

*Review current posts to avoid reposting.*

For **true stories** that that you could have sworn were from [The Onion](http://theonion.com/).

[](/spikeholdup) Please note that we are an editorialized subreddit devoted to showcasing articles that **read like satire**. Most submissions do not make the cut, so please do not treat removals under Rule 2 as personal attacks: They are simply the results of our content model.

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be "Oniony". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall, survey wall, or pop-over of any kind in order read the complete article uninterrupted.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

###Before posting 

* Make sure to [ read the rules!](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules)

* This subreddit is for asking for objective explanations. It is not a repository for any question you may have.

* E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.

* LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.

* Perform a keyword search, you may find good explanations in past threads. You should also consider looking for your question in the FAQ.

* Don't post to argue a point of view.


* Flair your question after you've submitted it.

####Rules
#1. Post title must be a current, unbiased, and coherent question
- The title is the most important aspect of creating a post. If it's hard for other users to understand what you are asking then it will be hard to get an answer. 
 - **Current** - The topic of the post you are creating must be a trending event that has happened recently.
 - **Unbiased** - Don't put your own twist on it to make it come off negative or positive. Try to be as neutral as possible. 
 - **Coherent** - Write a complete question that is clear about what you are trying to ask. Don't simply put one word and a question mark. 
 - **Format** - **[Include the format listed here.](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/titles)**


#2. Post must include context and resources in the body of the text
- Context is key when trying to find a proper answer. The more we know about what you are asking, the better we can answer with more information. 
 - **Context** - Add some words to your post so there is more to work with than a title. Words such as; what you saw, where you saw it, how often you saw it. 
 - **Resources** - You obviously saw it somewhere; link to the thing that made you ask. Or include a screenshot.  


#3. No ad nauseam, recently reposted, or retired questions
- Often times what you are asking has already been answered. Be sure to search the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) before creating a new post.
 - **Ad nauseam** - The topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.
 - **Recently reposted** - A topic is popular and is posted multiple times within a short period of time.
 - **Retired** - The '[Big List of Retired Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)' is a wiki page created by the mods that lists overly asked questions that have been thoroughly answered. Duplicates of retired questions may be removed.

#4. Top-level comments must begin with "Answer:", and be a genuine, unbiased, and coherent answer
- People are here to find answers to their questions. If top-level comments are riddled with memes or non-answers then no one wins. 
 - **Begin with "Answer:"** - This helps weed out low-effort, rule-breaking comments, as well as allows the comments to be more organized.
 - **Genuine** - Attempt to answer with words; don't pop in to tell users to search or drop a link without explanation.
 - **Unbiased** - Answer without putting your own twist of bias towards the answer. However, after you leave an unbiased response, you can add your own opinion as long as it's clearly marked, starting with "Biased:".
 - **Coherent** - Write in complete sentences that are clear about what you are trying to say.

#5. Be nice, follow etiquette
- This subreddit is supposed to be a helpful place for confused redditors.
 - **Be nice** - Be polite in your exchanges, vote based on whether a comment contributes to the discussion and not on whether you agree with the opinion, etc.
 - **Follow etiquette** - When in doubt, refer to [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/w/reddiquette/).

#6. [No AI Generated Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/12sc951/slight_housekeeping_new_rule_no_ai_generated/)

# Subreddit Rules             
https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/wiki/index/

+ If you think that your post doesn’t violate this rule but still mildly falls in this category then make sure to mark it as NSFW. 

####3) No War or Politics related posts 
+ War or Politics related posts are generally not allowed in this subreddit.
+ However such posts can be allowed, if their main focus is not war or politics.        

####4) No Misleading Content    
+ Make sure the content you are posting is not fake, staged or misleading.

####5) Don’t be rude to others   
+ Be civil and do not troll or harass others.

2025-10-19 15:04:21,887 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description The subreddit to share your tales of the people you just can't get away from.  Whether you share a room, an apartment, a floor, a washing machine, or just a refrigerator, we want to hear your story.

Having problems with your landlord?  Check out [r/tenant](https://www.reddit.com/r/tenant).

Please follow the [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) when posting.


##Rules



1. Relevancy - Posts must be about your bad roommates, not landlords or general issues with people. Joke posts/shitposts (i.e. Pictures of your pets) aren't allowed. Posts that are just revenge stories aren't allowed.

2. Civility - Users must abide by the [sitewide TOS](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Any suggestions or calls for violence will be met with a permanent ban. Do not attempt to harass anyone mentioned in posts on this sub, on behalf of the OP or otherwise.

3. Personal identifiable information must be removed. Posts containing any identifiable information will be removed. Attempting to find personal information of anyone in the post will be met with a permanent ban.


4. Update posts - Making an update to your previous situation is fine, but this sub is not for posting serials. Post major updates in an update post if you feel it's warranted, but minor updates should either be communicated via updates to the original posts or comments. While this will be primarily enforced by mod discretion, users who make excessively frequent posts about their situation(s) will start having their posts removed.

5. No spam of any kind. **Soliciting donations, directly or indirectly, will be met with an immediate permanent ban.**

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable. Please message the moderators before attempting to submit a text/self post.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyze the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, BlueSky, Instagram, Threads, etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, blatant disregard of reality and abusive trolling, bad-faith abusive comments, flaming and baiting, and bigotry/hate in any form are not allowed and will be removed and the user will be banned.

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 


##4. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). 

* **Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion. Do not submit *anything* you are affiliated with (this applies to News Organizations as well)**

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).


* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time.

####[NORMAL THEME](http://www.reddit.com//r/unpopularopinion)
***

##**How This Place Works**
* **Upvote:** Opinions that you Disagree with.    
* **Downvote:** Opinions that you Agree with.

##**Banned topics** 
* **Porn, Fat/Skinny/Body Weight, Pedophilia or Related topics, Posts about Sexual Assault, Nazi and related content, [Banned Topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/wiki/index/)**
    

##**Rules** 
* **If you see a post that breaks one or more of these rules, please report it so the moderators can take action.**  

Rule 1: **Your post must be an unpopular opinion.**

* Your post must be an opinion. Not a question. Not a showerthought. Not a rant. Not a proposal. Not a fact. An opinion. One opinion. A subjective statement about your position on some topic. Please have a clear, self contained opinion as your post title, and use the text field to elaborate and expand on why you think/feel this way.

* Your opinion must be unpopular. Unpopularity is a bit like an onion. It has layers. Be specific as to where you believe your opinion is unpopular.

Rule 2: **Do not post low effort/satirical/troll posts.**

* We get it, you all think this sub is garbage and is just for popular opinions, and you want to be funny and post "going to be downvoted to oblivion here, but I think racism is bad." We enjoy the memes, but please keep them off the sub.

* AI/ChatGPT, low effort, clickbait, rage bait, and/or gotcha posts are subject to removal. 

* Filter evasion is a bannable offense. Filter evasion consists of using words or characters in the place of others (i.e. R@pe, sewer slide and Sh!t).

Rule 3: **Do not post opinions that are heavily posted/have been on the front page recently.**

* Recent reposts are not allowed.

* Opinions that are constantly posted here are not allowed.

* Posts relating to highly popular topics aren't allowed outside of the relevant megathreads. You can find a list of the topics and their respective megathreads in a post on the top of the sub.

* POSTS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT ARE NOT ALLOWED. No, this isn't censoring criticism, they're just overposted. If you have a meta opinion, put it in the megathread.

* We ask that if a post fails to post do not just spam repost it; message mod mail.

Rule 4: **Be Civil.**

* This applies for both your behaviour on the sub, and the opinions which you post.

* Obey the sitewide rules and [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette).

* No racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or general bigotry.

* Some opinions are so inappropriate/offensive that they'll be removed as hate posts. These posts are usually, but not exclusively, those that target a particular sex, race, sexual orientation, etc, when the user in question is hostile, vulgar or aggressive towards said group.

Rule 5: **No Political Posts.**

* Our users have voted for no political posts in this sub, and this rule will not be changed until the majority votes otherwise. 

* It's very unlikely your political post is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to use the Politics Megathread pinned to the front page. Our civility rules apply at all times.


Rule 6.
**No r/self style posts**

* Please refrain from posting anything that resembles an r/self-style post.

* This is not the subreddit to be sharing personal anecdotes, likes or dislikes. We want unpopular, thought provoking, and unique opinions on your chosen topic.

7.
**No Banned/Mega-Thread topics**

* Please do not post from (or mention) any of our mega-thread or banned topics such as:

* Race, Religion, LGBTQ, Meta, Politics, Parenting/Family issues.

2025-10-19 15:04:21,955 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **Welcome to our community!**

This is the place to discuss anything and everything pop culture, from movies, memes, and music to celebrity gossip and analytical discussions.

You can snark OR stan, but keep it civil and don't attack people you don't agree with.

This is an inclusive community and ALL members should be treated with respect. No bigotry, no bullying, no harassment.

**Keep it cute or keep it mute!**

Please read the following rules before posting and commenting. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us via modmail. Thanks!

**CIVIL DISCUSSION ONLY**
This subreddit is for civil discussion only. While shade, wit &amp; snark are welcome, bullying, harassment, bigotry &amp; personal attacks are not. 

Do not attack other users for their fandom. Do not use someone's post history to attack them. Do not bait users. Treat everyone with respect. Attack the argument, not the person. Violations of this rule will result in an immediate ban.

This is not "Mean Girls." Everyone can sit with us if they are respectful &amp; engaging in good faith.

Keep it cute or keep it mute!

**NO ISMS / PHOBIAS / HATE SPEECH**
While we support marginalized communities' rights to reclaim slurs, we do NOT support bigotry or using bigoted language to denigrate anyone. This includes but is not limited to: racism, sexism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia &amp; xenophobia.

This subreddit is an inclusive LGBTQ+, BIPOC woman-dominated space. Bigotry is not welcome here.

**RUMORS &amp; GOSSIP**
Do not mislead or use poor sourcing. Any unverified rumors should be clearly labeled as such &amp; only cite from respected &amp; reputable sources. Anything else will be removed.

We provide a weekly tea discussion post where you can discuss unverified gossip. Please keep it in the space we provide for you.

**APPEARANCE &amp; OBJECTIFICATION**
No objectification, slut shaming, slurs or derogatory insults on appearance and/or weight. 

A lot of celebrities have had work done, and many may alter their online appearances with photoshop and other filters. 

It’s fine (and healthy!) to discuss these things in a world obsessed with beauty standards but we don’t need to be overly negative and tear someone down to do that. 

If someone can't change their appearance within minutes, don't make negative comments. Be kind!

**CELEBRITY CHILDREN**
Self-explanatory. Immediate bans for any negative comments directed to or about anyone under the age of 18. 

Photos of celebrity children without their parents (yes this includes bday posts or creepy fan sites for celeb children) will be removed &amp; the post authors will be suspended pending review.

We do allow photos that have been posted publicly by the parents on social media. However, be very respectful &amp; don't make an entire post dedicated just to the child.

**SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS**
It’s fine to share social media posts but we require the names to be blocked out unless it’s a verified account, meme, a celebrity or the name has appeared in the news (public). Posts that violate this rule will be removed until the information is hidden.

**USE THE SPOILER FLAIR**
Since this is a pop culture sub we will talk about new releases &amp; spoilers. However, we require all spoilers to use the spoiler flair. Comments with spoilers not in a flaired spoiler post must be covered. No spoilers in the title.

**NO META DISCUSSION**
No meta discussion allowed!

We will have regular meta &amp; off-topic posts where members of the sub can talk about everything under the sun that is not celeb-related. Every other time? Stay on topic &amp; keep it cute. 

If you have suggestions or wish to vent you can always use modmail or discuss it in the areas we provide for meta chat. Repeatedly ignoring this rule will result in a ban. 

If you decide to leave the sub, you don’t need to make a post to say goodbye.

**NO LOW EFFORT POSTS**
No low effort/low quality posts or post titles. You must put in an effort! 

Text posts: Descriptions are required! Share information expounding upon your title. 

Links: Titles should have a description of what you're sharing. Otherwise leave a comment with context.

Photos: You must leave a comment providing context if it isn't apparent in the title. 
 
**This is to encourage discussion and because not everyone knows every pop culture reference or celebrity.**

**NO REPOSTS**
To keep the conversations fresh &amp; interesting, similar posts may be removed. All reposts of megathread questions/topics or pinned content will be removed. 

Reposts are defined as posting the same meme, content, question, news article, etc. with similar titles, discussion questions, or the like. Do not rehash the same topic by posting something that could be a comment in a current thread.

If there's already a current post for the topic, you can provide updates with images/links in the comments.

**HEALTH ANALYSIS &amp; TRIGGERS**
No overly invasive diagnoses of strangers or suggestive commentary about their physical or mental health, including addiction. No armchair diagnosing. Be extremely mindful of the language you use. 

Respect boundaries &amp; respect that your experiences are not everyone’s. Most importantly respect your own energy and know when to step back.

For posts with triggering content, a brief description is required in the first line of the text post (e.g. TW: Reason). Use the trigger warning post flair.

**DEADNAMING &amp; PRONOUNS**
Respect this always, regardless of the context or if referring to someone pre-transition. If you are unsure they/them will suffice. Any &amp; all wilful disrespect with this rule is a ban worthy offense. No excuses.

**NO SPAM OR SELF-PROMOTION**
No links to your own social media, companies, blogs, brands, unverified news sources, etc. 

Self created content, such as fan-art/fan-edits, are allowed &amp; encouraged! There are exceptions if a video or article is a deep dive or informational. In these cases, we ask for context to open discussion on said post. Moderator discretion applies.

**POLITICAL &amp; SOCIETAL DEBATE**
No overly politcal posts or comments. While we do allow discussions around politics, this isn't a political sub. If it doesn't fit in pop culture, it doesn't belong here.

There will be times where societal discussions happen. Healthy discussion around societal topics  are fine as long as you engage in good faith.

Be respectful to others who do not share your viewpoint. If someone is purposely trolling, do not engage! Report any rule violations to the mods via the report button or modmail.

**AGREE TO DISAGREE &amp; MOVE ON**
While civil discussion is encouraged, arguing for the sake of arguing &amp; flame wars is not. No one needs to have the last word. Know when to agree to disagree &amp; move on.

Respect boundaries. If someone says they are done discussing things with you, do not continue to engage. If you continue, you will be subject to a ban.

#2. No Politics (TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED)

* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding "Reddit Justice" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#4. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos.

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#7. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs are disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against Reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

#9. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.

#10. No Self Promotion (temp)

* We are currently not allowing any self promotional content. There is a forthcoming policy change that will address promoting your own content - please stay tuned!

#Need help with your relationship? 

######Whether it's romance, friendship, family, co-workers, or basic human interaction: we're here to help! 

1. **Posts must contain a title _that includes basic information such as ages, genders, length of relationship_ with text that has a description, a TLDR, and a direct answerable question.**

2. **All submissions must request advice on a specific situation between two or more people**. No submissions *giving advice*, no links, no youtube videos, hypotheticals, general discussion/DAE/polls, chatGPT generated content, adverts, or spam. 

3. **No yes or no questions** If your question boils down to a yes or no answer, you will need to reformulate it and repost it. For an example of what type question this would be [please see this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r6w9uh/meta_am_i_overreacting_am_i_the_asshole_is_this/)

4. **Things this sub can't give advice on**: Rants, unsolicited advice, letters to an ex, "body counts" or number of sexual partners, mental health issues, medical health issues, legal problems, financial problems, any situations involving minors (under 18 regardless of local laws), and any situations involving abuse (violence, sexual, emotional etc). All of these will be removed and locked. 

5. **You can submit an update post exactly once at any time after 48 hours has past from the original post.**

6. **Surveys, information requests, journalistic and academic research questions must be sent to modmail here and approved prior to posting.** If you're doing educational work, [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) with your IRB number, a point of contact for us to verify your pending research, and the details of your research for consideration. Press Requests must be routed through u/eganist (via modmail. [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice)) before communicating with users directly.


************************

1. **All comments must be on topic and focus on the OP, in good faith.** Give good, ethical advice. Derailing arguments, jokes, fights, and moral whataboutism is not allowed. Remember, the goal is to help your fellow human.

2. **Keep it civil**. No name calling, insults, or insensitive language ([details](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/wiki/insults)). Insulting anyone (be it OP, the subject of the post, someone you know/used to know, users, etc) will result in post/comment removal, and the user being banned. This includes, but is not limited to: Whore, ho, hoe, slut, bitch, idiot, moron, slut shaming (including "I can't get over their past"), slurs against someone's racial, ethnic, religious, gender or sexual identity. ***Please note that this is not an all-inclusive list.***. You will be banned. All bans in this sub are permanent. You don't get a free pass. We do not care who started it, or how deserving you think the subject of your ire.

3. **No referencing hateful or abusive subs/individuals and content**. No espousing rhetoric/linking to subs or content that is conspiratorial in nature, transphobic, anti-women/men, anti-LBGT+, that promote anti-vaxx or anti-science content, or contains harmful rhetoric against groups of people. You will be banned. All bans in this sub are permanent. You don't get a free pass. [More information can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/wiki/index)

4. **Do not directly message other users.** 
If you wish to opine on the matter at hand, you are to comment on the post. Users found to be privately messaging other users to circumvent this directive will be met with a permanent, irrevocable ban. We highly recommend that users turn off their DM's in their settings to prevent this.

**If a user has sent you harassing messages, please upload your screenshot to Imgur.com, and notify the mods via modmail. We will action the user accordingly.**

###SUBREDDIT RULES

|Rule|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Full List of Rules|This rule list is a summary of consistent ones that pop up, so please check out the full rules list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/wiki/rules/).|
|1.1 Personal Attacks|Comments and posts that are intended to attack or insult other users are not allowed. It's okay to disagree with someone, but using ad hominem attacks instead of having an actual discussion is not acceptable.|
|1.2 Discrimination|Attacks based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, nationality, ancestry, or religion are prohibited. Civil discussion is permitted, but using these traits as weapons is not allowed.|
|1.3 Witch-Hunting|Spreading a negative campaign against a particular group of people or a specific individual by sharing their information with others is not allowed. This includes raiding servers/users.|
|1.4 Calls to Action|Any attempts to rally the community for a particular purpose, such as voting for a poll, promoting a boycott, seeking funding or support for a cause, or advertising a petition, will be removed as it is considered a "call to action". This also includes requests to find certain people. However, please note that polls or contests created specifically for the subreddit are allowed.|
|2.1 Low-effort Submissions|Moderators may remove content that is deemed as low-effort. This includes but is not limited to **quality, memes, rants, screenshots lacking info/context, vague titles, &amp; posts irrelevant to Discord**. *[Full description](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/wiki/rules/#wiki_2.1_low-effort_submissions)*|
|2.2 Safe For Work Content Only|Excessively violent or sexual content, including but not limited to death threats, explicit content, gore, or content that sexualizes or harasses other users is not allowed. However, discussing NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is allowed as long as it is tagged appropriately and is relevant to the discussion.|
|2.3 Client Modifications|Client modifications such as Better Discord and BeautifulDiscord are not supported and are considered a violation of Discord's Terms of Service. Therefore, we do not discuss these matters on the subreddit. Third-party add-ons like these are not safe to use. Installing any third-party software that modifies the Discord client can create vulnerabilities that may expose you to malicious code or result in the loss of your account. It is highly recommended to avoid using such software to ensure the security of your Discord account.|
|3.1 Recently Posted Topics|Reposted topics are not allowed. Threads that focus on topics that have been discussed at high frequency, cover information from the same angle, or are covered in our FAQ pages may be removed. Please use the Reddit search bar, check /new, or the front page as this is a topic that has been largely posted/discussed recently.|
|3.2 Advertising/Self-Promotion|No advertising/self-promoting servers, selling/buying accounts, trading, or nitro begging. Server self-promotion will result in an immediate perm ban. Advertising personal bots/projects is allowed if it does not make up a notable portion of your account history.|
|3.3 Code Giveaways|We do not allow giveaways on this subreddit as they create spam and we cannot verify that all users receive their prizes (when required to enter). If you want to give away your code(s), please use this [post](https://redd.it/18s8fwf).|
|3.4 Third-Party Bot Support|If you are having trouble with a third-party bot, we recommend you contact their support team. Try searching the bots name on Google as most bots have a support website or server. Some of the more popular ones are [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/discord), [Mee6](https://discord.gg/mee6), [YAGPDB](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5), &amp; [Carl-bot](https://discord.gg/S2ZkBTnd8X)|
|4.1 Account Support|This subreddit is not the appropriate place to post account-related issues/requests/complaints. If you are having an issue with Discord's product or need to contact them for any reason, please [search their support knowledge base](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) for answers or send a ticket to Discord’s [support team](https://dis.gd/contact). If you've already sent a ticket, please be patient and wait for an answer. The support team often has a slow response time due to the number of open tickets.|
|4.2 User/Server Report|Discord removed the trust and safety option from [dis.gd/report](https://dis.gd/report) a while ago, so the only way to report content is by doing it on Discord directly. If you believe a user/server has violated ToS, please report them/it using [these directions](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord).|
|4.3 Bug Reporting or Feature Requests|Technical questions and issues other users may be able to assist with are allowed, but bug reports should be shared directly with Discord. You can use the Bug Megathread pinned to the front page or submit a [bug report](https://dis.gd/bugreport). Learn about bugs [here](https://dis.gd/bugs) for instructions! While feature requests and feedback inspire awesome discussions on the subreddit, we encourage sharing them with Discord directly via a [Discord Feedback](https://dis.gd/feedback) submission. Submitting there guarantees higher visibility from the people who can implement the suggestions.|
|5. Reddit rules|Reddit's content policy and terms of service must be followed at all times. Some of our other subreddit rules overlap with the site-wide rules, but such rules provide more information specific to r/discordapp to help you understand what kind of content is allowed. Please review proper [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) before submitting.|
(Hover over a specific rule for more information!)

###Modmail Disclaimer
We only respond to modmail sent in English. If you are unable to communicate in English, please use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). While our moderation team strives to provide coverage across multiple countries, we are unable to moderate all languages properly.

---

**The sidebar is a summary. [Please see our full rules wiki page.](/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules) Mouse over for futher details.**
##  **Rule 0: Be civil**

&gt; No personal attacks, witch-hunts, inflammatory or hateful language. If what you are saying is going to offend, upset or provoke another user it breaks this rule.

&gt; No bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia or transphobia. /r/pcgaming is an inclusive space. Any negative comments regarding someone's race, creed, nationality or sexual identity will result in a permaban.

&gt; No trolling or baiting.

&gt; No calls for violence against any groups or individuals.

&gt; Any account less than 90 days old may be permanently banned on the first infraction of this rule.

##  **Rule #1: No spam, porn, or facilitating piracy**

&gt; [**Please see our full rules on self-promotion here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/selfpromotion)

&gt; [**Please see our full rules on piracy here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/piracy)

## **Rule #2:  No advertisements**

&gt; Ads include, but are not limited to, chat/game server &amp; community recruitment (i.e. [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785), TeamSpeak), contextless website or subreddit links, and listings on eBay or other sales platforms.

&gt; No affiliate or referral links: This includes Amazon, GMG tap links, Star Citizen, etc.

&gt; Developers must be [verified](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/developers) before posting about their projects and, once they are, are not bound by rule #2.

##  **Rule #3: No memes, PCMR language, or low-effort posts/comments**

&gt; This includes contextless images/screenshots/GIFs as well as anti-platform or PCMR language such as "master race" and calling people peasants.  

&gt; Low effort posts/comments and submissions not attempting to create discussion are prohibited.

##  **Rule #4: No tech support or game help questions**

&gt; Tech support questions can be posted in our stickied tech support thread or, if you need immediate assistance, in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785).

&gt; General game related discussion is allowed, but game-specific help requests (how to defeat a certain boss or level, what loadout is best for my character, etc) and basic questions (is a game co-op, does this game have controller support, etc) aren't. Those questions would be more appropriate for our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) or the game's subreddit if it exists.

##  **Rule #5:  No questions about building/buying computers, hardware, peripherals, furniture, etc**

&gt; This includes "Can my PC run this?" type questions, links showing off your computer build, or asking questions about builds.

&gt; Use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) for all PC building questions. You can also try /r/buildapc, /r/buildapcforme, /r/SuggestALaptop, /r/headphones, /r/monitors, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and /r/mousereview for more specific questions.

##  **Rule #6: No game suggestions, friend requests, surveys, or begging.**

&gt; Game suggestion requests and all their variations belong in the weekly game suggestion thread that runs from Fri - Sun. Alternatively, we also have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-pcgaming-482363499977375785) channel where you can ask for game suggestions.

&gt; This includes group/clan recruitment. Our Discord has channels for finding people to play with.

&gt; We no longer allow surveys. You can try /r/samplesize.

&gt; Please don’t make requests for spare game keys or PC parts. GoFundMe and other fundraising posts are also prohibited.

##  **Rule #7: No Let's Plays, streams, highlight reels/montages, random videos or shorts**

&gt; In addition to this, Youtube links posted by new accounts are filtered due to channel spamming.

##  **Rule #8: No off-topic posts/comments**

&gt; Keep posts and comments related to PC gaming and the topic being discussed.

## **Rule #9: Use the original source, no editorialized titles, no duplicates**

&gt; Submissions must use the original source when available. Sources that are from Twitter/X, pay-walled, not in english, and corporate earning calls are exempted from this rule.

&gt; Don't editorialize your titles. In the case of clickbait, or content lacking context, you may **lightly** edit the title. Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules#wiki_rule_9.3A_use_the_original_source.2C_no_editorialized_titles.2C_no_duplicates).

#### **[Allowed submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* News and articles
&gt;* Reviews and previews
&gt;* Informative self-posts
&gt;* Questions likely to generate discussion

###### **[Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1. No content primarily for humor or entertainment
&gt;2. No personal attacks, witch hunts, bigotry, or inflammatory language
&gt;3. No off-topic or low-effort content or comments
&gt;4. No duplicate posts

&gt;6. Follow all [formatting requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_6_-_formatting_requirements)

&gt;8. Promotion must be kept within [acceptable limits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_8_-_promotional_content_requirement)

##### Promotion
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Some promotional submitting (posting your own projects, articles, etc.) is permitted, but it must be balanced out by a *much* greater level of non-promotion participation in reddit - the rule of thumb is no more than 10% of your submissions may be promotional. **[Do not solicit votes for your posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/).** For more information, [see the self-promotion on reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).
&gt;
&gt;**If you want to promote without participating in the community, [purchase an ad](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)**.

##### Spoilers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Please report posts containing spoilers unless they are hidden using the following method or are inside a thread clearly labeled as containing spoilers.
&gt;
&gt;Format: `**Spoiler:** &gt;!X Kills Y!&lt;`  
&gt;Result: **Spoiler:** &gt;!X Kills Y!&lt;

&gt;Posting unmarked spoilers will result in removal and warning, and posting spoilers with malicious intent will result in a ban.

**r/ChatGPT Rules**  
All users are encouraged to report posts to the moderators for review.
___

**1: Malicious Communication**  
Posters and commenters are expected to act in good faith. Treat other users the way you want to be treated. Avoid straw-manning and bad-faith interpretations. Avoid presenting misinformation as factual.

**2: No Trashposts**  
Posts deemed to be entirely without value or effort may be removed if they have not generated interesting discussions before their discovery. Users are encouraged to report posts they feel are of significantly low effort. Specifically mentioning that “Is chat GPT down posts?” will be removed. The stickied FAQ deals with that.

**3: Self Advertising**  
Posts must be directly related to ChatGPT or the topic of LLMs. They may not be solely focused on advertising a single other LLM service. Find or establish a relative subreddit for that service.

**4: Political Discussion**  
Having ChatGPT create political content is completely fine. Discussion of the politics around AI and LLMs is allowed. This is not the place to discuss the merits of Trump's foreign policy or Hunter Biden’s laptop.

**5: No NSFW Content**  
This is a SFW sub. Any posts violating this rule will be removed, and repeated offenses may result in a ban.

**6: GPT-4o/GPT-5 complaints**

If you have an issue with the change from 4o to 5, please voice your concerns in the dedicated megathread.

**7: AI Art**

- Quality over Quantity: AI art submissions are allowed only if they showcase something unique, unusual, or particularly interesting. Generic memes, low-effort images, or art intended solely for karma farming will be removed.

- Encourage Tech Discussion: Posts that include insights, techniques, or thought-provoking commentary about the AI process or technology behind the art are highly encouraged.

- Mod Discretion: Mods reserve the right to remove posts that do not meet the above criteria.

#Rules:

**1. No bigotry or harassment** -
Bigotry is intolerance towards a person or group of people as a result of their identity. Harassment is repeated aggressive interactions with an individual. Neither of these behaviors are acceptable and will result in a ban.

**2. No spambots** -
The following may indicate that a user is a bot: new account, nonsensical username, no or irrelevant post flair, lack of profile customization, lack of commenting history, nonsensical comments.

**3. Posts must be screenshots of Tumblr posts** -
This subreddit is intended to share screenshots of Tumblr posts. If your post is not relevant, it will be removed. If the entirety of your post consists of a screenshot from another website posted on Tumblr, it will be considered irrelevant.

**4. No recent reposts** -
Before posting, try to ensure it has been at least 2 weeks since the post was last submitted to the subreddit. Recent reposts will be removed. When reporting a repost, please provide a link to the post it is a duplicate of in the comments.

**5. Mark NSFW and spoilers** -
Mark anything sexual, gross, or off-putting as NSFW. Mark any posts which could spoil a piece of media as a Spoiler. Reported posts will be marked by the mods if they deem it necessary.

**6. Mark fandom posts with the relevant fandoms** -
Any posts about a specific fandom should be flaired with the fandom name OR include the name of the fandom somewhere in the title. If the post is a Self-post Sunday post, use the Self-post Sunday flair instead.

**7. Avoid spreading misinformation** -
Posts containing mild misinformation will be flared with the “Misinformation” flair. Posts or comments containing serious misinformation will be removed.

**8. Posts must be legible** -
If a post is distorted, corrupted, extremely low definition, or otherwise cannot be read, it will be removed.

**9. Do not post content from the blogs on the do-not-post list** -
Blogs on the [do-not-post list](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/wiki/blacklist) do not wish to have their posts shared to the subreddit. Posts from blacklisted blogs will be removed. If you wish to have your blog(s) added to the blacklist, please contact the moderators.

**10. Self-posts on Sundays only** -
Self-posting is posting a screenshot that contains content produced exclusively by yourself. These types of posts should only be submitted on Sunday's and must be flaired with the "Self-post Sundays" flair or they will be removed.

**RULES**

**1.NO POLITICS ** 
Posting politics results in a **permanent ban and a 28 day mod Mail mute**. Please see the pinned post to see what qualifies as politics. Unhinged political arguments in the comments can also result in a permanent ban. 

**2. No Reposts**
Make sure you aren't submitting a post that has already been submitted. It's a good idea to browse our top 100 posts of all time to avoid making this mistake and to familiarize yourself with the subreddit. Frequent reposting may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. No Advertising**
While you are allowed to post your own content on this subreddit (which MUST use the flair "OC"), do not post videos with the title advertising your TikTok page. This includes phrases such as "follow me, like my TikTok, etc." No linking your TikTok page in comments unless it is under your own video. This will result in your post/comment being immediately deleted. Blatant advertisement trying to get views or followers for yourself/others will result in a permanent ban.

**4. Flair Posts Correctly**
All posts must be marked and flaired correctly. This makes it easier for users to sort by flair to see the content they are looking for. If a moderator feels your post is not flaired correctly, the flair may be changed or the post may be removed.

**5. All Original Content MUST be Flaired as Such**
Along with rule 3, all original content posted MUST use the “OC” flair. We would like our users to know if you created the video you posted. This also helps prevent self advertisement and spam. Users not following this rule should be reported immediately and will receive a one month ban.

**6. Posts Must Be From TikTok**
All posts must be directly from TikTok. This means that you can clearly see the original creator's username as well as the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. Any video with the original poster's username cut out will not be considered a TikTok. Violation of this rule may result in a temporary ban.

**7. No Hate Speech**
There will be zero tolerance for explicit racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny.

**8. No Doxxing or Witch-Hunting**
No doxxing or witch hunting. This includes but is not limited to asking for or sharing personal information such as names, social media links, phone numbers, etc.

**9. No Compilations/YouTube Video Re-uploads**
Compilations or YouTube video re-uploads are prohibited. This includes ripped YouTube TikToks.

**10. No Bad-Faith Posts Featuring Anyone Who Is Mentally Ill Or Disabled**
Content focused on exploiting mentally ill or disabled individuals is banned.

**11. Be Civil In Comments**
Rude, vulgar, or offensive comments targeting other members is not allowed. Report issues instead of engaging in negativity.

**12. Don't Complain About the Subreddit Name**
The subreddit evolved long ago last it's roots of "only cringe-worthy" content. There have been two community polls where over 85% of users agreed to include all content. It's come to the point where users who say "This isn't cringe" or anything of that sort, may receive a temporary ban. We have made this clear enough with a pinned comment on every single post.

**13. No Karma Farming**
If we suspect you are using r/TikTokCringe to karma farm, you will be banned.

**14. No Promoting OnlyFans Or Other Adult Websites**
If you are suspected of making posts on r/TikTokCringe to draw users to your Reddit account to promote your OnlyFans or other adult websites, you will be banned.

Please read the rules before posting!

# [**READ THE STICKIED MEGATHREAD!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/wiki/megathread//)

**RULES:**
#1. Links to copyrighted material
**You are not allowed to request or post links to any illegal or copyrighted infringing content.** Top level domains are the only links permitted here, links that aren't top-level domains will be removed. (e.g. piracysite.com = allowed, piracysite.com/free-game-download.html = not allowed).

Link shortners of any kind for any link are prohibited.

Magnet links and .torrent files are not allowed.


#2. Off-topic posts and discussion
All posts, comments and discussions here must be game piracy related. If they aren't they will be removed. This rule also cover game recommendation posts.

Non-game piracy related posts should be posted in r/Piracy.

To check if a game is cracked, go to r/CrackWatch.


#3. Spam or promotion
Do not spam or promote anything here.

If you have made a website, or are releasing a tool / guide that can enable piracy, message the moderators first through Mod Mail.

Guides should be textual and may include images/links to images/gifs. YouTube video posts of any sort aren't allowed.

Accounts younger than 7 days are not allowed to post or comment, in order to reduce bot-spam.


#4. Reddiquette
Follow reddiquette. This includes being nice, civil and helpful to one another, disrespectful posts/comments will be removed. Do not make sexist or racist remarks.


#5. Requests
**You are not allowed to ask for games or cracks.** Do not ask for links. Do not offer links. Do not even offer to give links to DMs.

Do not make a post "Where can I find X game?" - this subreddit is for support and discussion. You can find sites that have plenty of pirated games in the stickied Mega Thread.

Posts in any style of looking for a game will be removed (unless discussed with the moderators, in exceptional cases).

#6. Recommending Dangerous Site
Do not recommend or link to any dangerous sites.

Some untrusted sites are listed in the [Mega Thread](https://rentry.org/pgames).

If you think a dangerous site is safe, make a post providing ample evidence.


#7. Redundant Question
This is a redundant question. These include (but are not limited to): Is X site safe?, Do I need a VPN?, Which VPN / Antivirus do I need?, Is this a false-positive?, Is X game cracked?, When will X game be cracked? etc.

Before posting, read the [Megathread](https://rentry.org/pgames) first.
Simple questions will be redirected to the [Common Question and Answer thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/wiki/faq).


#8. Humor posts
Moderators reserve the right to remove any humor post. This could be down to the fact it doesn't suit the subreddit topic, poor effort, or just not funny.

&gt; In 2077 they voted my city the worst place to live in America. Main issues? Sky high rate of violence, and more people living below the poverty line than anywhere else. 

&gt;Can't deny it, it's all true, but everybody still wants to live here. This city's always got a promise for you.. Might be a lie, an illusion, but it's there, just around the corner.

2025-10-19 15:04:22,249 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - subscribers 5934178
2025-10-19 15:04:22,249 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **Post Requirements**
To help keep things nice, searchable, and maintainable, all posts must be prefixed with "A cool guide". For example, "A cool guide about identifying poison ivy", "A cool guide showing how to clean your house", or "A cool guide for painting your living room".

**Defining a Guide**

Guides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables.  It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.

**Defining An Infographic**

An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. 

**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**
These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.

***Subreddit Rules***

**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**

**2. Infographics will be removed.**

**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**

**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**

**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** 

If you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!

Many of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.

***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***

&gt; ###Community Rules:

&gt; 1. [](#icon-cross) **Don't be an asshole / be respectful to others.**

&gt;   Don't be an Asshole Pretty simple. This does not mean you can report people for saying mean things to you and hurting your feefees. We're not a safe space here, if you make a comment or an argument, be prepared to defend it if people call you out on your shit. Blatant racism, sexism, general bigotry etc. is punishable with a permanent ban.

&gt; 2. [](#icon-information) **Moderator’s Discretion.**

&gt;   The mod team reserves the right to ban anyone and remove any post/comment at any time for any reason.

&gt; 3. [](#icon-information) **Low Effort Posts**

&gt;   Mods will use discretion to determine if a post is worth approving for the sake of engagement, entertainment, lessons learned, just being a good question etc.

&gt;  Low effort posts may include: FAQs (search the FAQ), clickbait titles, yes/no questions, what/why/where/who/when/how men questions, bathroom/underwear/what do you do with your dick questions, questions that can be googled, questions deemed too stupid, and spam. AI comments and AI content in your profile will result in a ban..

&gt; 4. [](#icon-cross) **Dating/Relationship Advice**

&gt;   Do not make posts requesting dating or relationship advice, there are subs specifically centered around these topics. Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking. We don't know them and can't speak for them. This also includes how to get over breakups, gift ideas and asking how to support your partner. Go to r/askmenadvice or r/askmenrelationships.

&gt; 5. [](#icon-cross) **Affirmation/Validation/Forever Alone/Self Deprecating/General Attention Whoreishness**

&gt;   Post at your own risk because you will receive rightfully condescending and rude comments, be made fun of, and your post will most likely be removed once everyone has had enough.

&gt;  This includes affirmation of your appearance, body features, personality traits or life situation, asking about what men think about this that and the other type of woman, what make up, hair color, height, BMI, astrological sign, credit score, or instrument is best/sexiest/most likely to trap a man in marriage.

&gt; 6. [](#icon-cross) **Agenda Posting/Potstirring**

&gt;   Do not post a question that is obviously geared towards creating an echo chamber where you can either a) create a circlejerk about how everyone agrees with you or b) get into fights with everyone because you're right and everyone else is a shitlord/plebian/whatever. If you want to get into stupid slapfights with people, then take it somewhere else.

&gt;  Do not link to other subreddits with the intention to draw attention to a certain post or comment. Only archived reddit post links will be approved..

&gt; 7. [](#icon-cross) **Medical Advice**

&gt;   Medical advice is not allowed here. We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet. This includes asking why your dick does whatever it does. We're tired of talking about dicks here.

&gt; 8. [](#icon-cross) **Political Posts**

&gt;   There are subs like r/politics, r/PoliticalDebate, and r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.

&gt; 9. [](#icon-cross) **Let’s talk about sex (respectfull)**

&gt;   This is a sub for adults and adults like to talk about sex. That's fine. What's not fine is posts that are obviously typed with one hand (we check your profiles and see way to much of this shit, we'll know if you really have a question about toilets or if it's fetish fuel) and obvious/feeble attempts to get sexual attention from men (see rule 5). On that note.

&gt; 10. [](#icon-cross) **Self Promotion**

&gt;   We do not allow any form of self-promotion or surveys on this sub. This includes OnlyFans and all similar sites, thirst trap accounts, external sites looking to farm responses for content, news articles, school projects, start ups, etc. The bot will automatically ban you if you have adult content links associated with your account - blame all assholes before you for trying to farm engagement on this sub.

&gt; 11. [](#icon-cross) **Answers From Men Only Flair**

&gt;   If a post is flaired "Answers from men only", only men should be providing top level answers in that post.

&gt;  Top level comments will be removed, other engagement will be moderated more heavily and removed at mod's discretion i.e., derailing, whataboutism, or if you're just here to fight or shit on men.

## RULES:

**Be kind or get banned.**  

ZERO tolerance. Act right or leave. Bullying, harassment, trolling, or antagonistic behavior (including falsely reporting posts) = immediate ban, no warning.

Don't instigate drama. Don't talk politics, this is a gaming sub. Don't report posts because you don't like them. If you have content removed and you approach the mods with courtesy, we will fix it or kindly explain why. If you are rude about it, we will ban you instead.

All bans are at mod discretion. This list is not exhaustive.

**Posts must be about or related to the Steam Deck.**

Posts must be on-topic and relevant to the Steam Deck (not just vaguely or tangentially related). Posts that are **NOT** allowed include:

- Unrelated posts - Submissions unrelated to the Steam Deck

- Peer requests - e.g. friend requests, LFG requests, etc.

- Game request posts - discussion posts are permitted

- "Bug" posts that are done to death, e.g 1969 reservation message, reservation message on Deck

- Other questions that are easily answered via an online search.

**Generic / New Steam Deck Pictures Limited To "Show Off Saturday" (GMT Timezone)**  

Generic images and New Steam Deck posts are limited to "Show Off Saturday" so other posts can get more attention during the week.

This limitation doesn't apply to "Game On Deck", "Accessory", "Setup" and "Hardware / Software Modding" posts which have their own rules.

Generic pictures include:

- Traveling with Steam Deck

- Playing with a Steam Deck in random locations

- Steam Deck with pets

- Waiting with a Steam Deck

(This list is not exhaustive, we may remove other similarly themed posts)

 **"Game On Deck" Posts Must Include Game In The Title And Steam Deck Experience** 

We want to avoid having to ask what the game is called or what it's like to play it on Deck, try adding as many details as possible such as performance, user experience (interface and controls) and any other information related to the Steam Deck experience.

**Requirements For "Accessory", "Setup" and "Hardware / Software Modding" Posts** 

Posts flaired with "Accessory", "Setup", or "Hardware / Software Modding" must include detailed personal experience and a list of parts / things used. This helps others make informed decisions and reduce redundant questions.

**“What Are You Playing?” Limited To Weekly Megathread**  

“What are you playing?” posts are restricted to the weekly megathread.

Feel free to share what you’re currently playing there or making a detailed post about it with a "Game On Deck" post.

(Please read "Game On Deck" related rule first)

**Giveaways, Begging, Buying, Selling, Trading And Crowdfunding Posts Are Not Allowed**

This community isn't r/hardwareswap or Kickstarter, if you want to giveaway a game go to r/RandomActsOfGaming or similar communities (don't post codes in plain text as bots will claim them).

We also do not allow non-reputable stores, auction sites, keyshops and affiliate links (without permission from the mod team).

**Repetitive Purchase And Shipping Questions Are Not Allowed**

Please use search as these questions have already been answered many times before.

**No links/discussion of illegal, copyrighted or pirated content**  

Please do not discuss or share links to illegal, copyrighted or pirated content.

Examples of content **NOT** allowed:

- Links directly to pirated games, ROMs or BIOSes

- Discussion or encouragement to partake in piracy

- Technical support for pirated games/software, including repacks and No CD cracks (except for abandonware)

Notable **EXCLUSIONS** from the rule:

- The game/software is abandonware

- Discussion regarding performance penalty vs legal version (aka Denuvo performance drops)

**No impersonation, claiming to have "insider knowledge", or posting intentional misinformation**  

Please do not impersonate another entity, claim to have insider knowledge when you do not, or provide intentional misinformation.

Examples of content **NOT** allowed:

- Advising a user to run a dangerous Linux terminal command

- Creating an account to mimic a trusted entity

- Claiming insider knowledge on an accessory or software update that is untrue

**Do not attempt to obfuscate your submission to bypass filtering**

We implement a variety of different automated filters to ensure that the rules are enforced effectively and fairly.

Please do not try to obfuscate your submissions to avoid filters, **including**:

- Using incorrect flairs on purpose

- Censoring parts of an insult, piracy link or shipping post

- Using image posts for what should be a text post.

**Promotional Rules for Developers, Content Creators, and Manufacturers** 

Please read this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1gh46oh/promotional_rules_for_developers_content_creators/

Message mod mail: https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2FSteamDeck

**No Abusing the report button**

Please don't report posts just because you don't like them, that's what downvotes are for. Reports are for posts that break sub rules and need immediate mod attention, not just because "I don't like this post" or "I don't think this topic belongs here." Reports are used to analyze sub content, tell mods if there are toxic users or posts that some may find insulting or offensive. Please don't indiscriminately report everything, use discretion and good judgement when reporting.

&gt; ### [Submission Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/wiki/guide#wiki_submission_guidelines)

&gt;&gt; All posts that are directly related to a series **require the series' title** in the title of the post.

&gt;&gt; For manga related news, use the [News] tag in your post

&gt;&gt; For art, use the following **[Art] Title of Choice (Name of the source Series)**. Manga panel crops or full pages and manga related fanart (remember to include the source in a comment) both fall under the [art] tag.

&gt;&gt; For Discussion submissions, please use the following link syntax: **[DISC] name of manga (chapter#) or (general questions: who's your favorite character? etc.)** Simple questions are not discussions and thus do not need the [DISC] tag.

&gt;&gt; If you are recommending manga (RT! = Read This!), please use the following:  **[RT!] name of manga (genres)** and be liberal with genres! Keep in mind that this is a recommendation from you to all of r/manga, so tell us why we should read it in your post!

&gt;&gt; **[SL]** for posts directly regarding or relating to Scanlation.

&gt;&gt;  If you're asking the entire community a question, put  **r/manga** in the link title.

This subreddit is not for standalone insults, but rather for when you stumble across them in forums, comments, or what have you.

Rare threats are also welcome (as long as you flair your post)

-----

#RULES

###1. Don't be a dick
It's not hard, just be nice to each other.

###2. No hateful insults
Don't post hateful insults

###3. No reposts
Don't repost. Please refer to our [common repost album.](https://imgur.com/a/8XDVQtt)

###4. Not a rare insult/threat
/r/rareinsults is not for unfunny/common insults, this includes insults that follow the random [adjective]+[noun] formula. It is only for rare insults. No other post types are allowed

Corporate insults also fall under this category. [Click here to learn more!](https://redd.it/ghj57g)

###5. No personal information
Personal information includes full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and usernames

###6. No politics
Political submissions will be removed and posters will be permanently banned.

This includes mention of politicians, political commentators, and political movements

###7. All posts require a proper title
No low effort titles or titles that contain the insult. Examples are "for those sorting by new" or "lmao he called this dude a deformed shrimp."

If your post is removed for another reason and you repost, do not title your post "reposting because it was removed."

###8. No long videos (&gt;10s) or long texts
Don't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.

###9. No image macros/memes
Posting memes or images with text on them(image macros) aren't allowed as they detract from the main point of the subreddit, which is rare insults. Memes are off-topic and belong in other subreddits.

###10. No crossposts

###11. No r/RoastMe
Insults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.

###12. Moderators' Discretion

Moderators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)

###13. Do not post your own insults

These insults are typically very low quality and not rare. If you insult someone and it is truly a rare insult, someone else will post it for you.

**RULES:**

1.) Provide all relevant information in your post.  Providing only one side of the story makes it easy to sympathize with that side, but it defeats the purpose of the subreddit.

2.) Don't spam.  Pointless, non-contributing posts may be deleted. Does this even have to be mentioned?

3.) This isn't a place to arrogantly pontificate. It is for seeking moral or ethical counsel; be respectful of each others' opinions.

4.) This *is* for ethical questions, more or less.  This *isn't* the place to ask "I prefer pizza to spaghetti. Am I wrong?"  OR  "I believe sexuality isn't a choice? Am I wrong?"  Such posts may be removed.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,105 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description #####Please read these

1. All posts must be cooking related.  After all, this is **/r/Cooking**. The name kind of says it all. If the topic is questionable, then it most likely isn't OK to post.  Content about or written/developed by AI such as ChatGPT will be removed as well.

2. Include plain text recipes for any food that you post, either in the post or in a comment. We love to see your food, but we also want to try it if we wish to.

3. No memes allowed. Not even cooking related memes.  Not all jokes are memes! No trolling, either. 

4. No social media/blog/YouTube channel spamming or advertisements of any kind. If you wish to promote cooking-related social media, blogs or or YouTube channels, please do so only in the weekly "YouTube/Content Round-Up!" thread, stickied at the top of the sub. No other advertisement is allowed, even cooking related (e.g., Pampered Chef, Cutco, etc). Reddit is for sharing, not self-promotion..

5. Be kind and conduct productive discussion. As a community, we should look out for each other, not put each other down or bog down discussion.  Any perpetuation of racial stereotypes may result in an immediate ban.

[**GENERAL RULES**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/about/rules/) &lt;- link for clarification

--------
**1 - Be excellent to each other** No toxic discourse or harassment and respect the humanity of others. This implies no tolerance of any kind of harassment, including their ethnicity/race/gender-orientation. No dogwhistle posts. No witch hunts.

**2 - If text on a meme can easily be googled for the answer or it explains itself, it doesn't belong here**

**3 - Low-effort posts/titles are not allowed**

**4 - Complaining about someone "not getting the joke" is not allowed** Gatekeeping is not tolerated in this sub.

**5 - If you already understood the joke, don't post it just to get some karma**

**6 - If your post is not a joke, it will be removed.**

**7 - Current events/celebrities/influencer questions should instead be posted to /r/OutOfTheLoop**

**8 - NSFW posts/comments must be tagged appropriately**

**9 - No sale threads, promotion, giveaways, assistance/fundraising requests, or self-advertisement**

**10 - Nothing related to self-harm or spreading personal information**

**11 - Keep it about explaining the joke (posts and top-level comments only)**

**12 - Specific Banned Comics/Memes** As requested by the community:

--------

**Non-Rules**    

--------
* PLEASE report any bots that you see. They typically have 6-7 month old accounts that only just started their first post 1-2 days ago, but sometimes they can be 1yr old.
* DO NOT abuse the report button. I will report any abuse of the button to reddit admins, and you can enjoy your site-wide punishments.
* Repost removal gets handled by bots. If it's a bad crop of a previous post, report it as breaking Rule 1 so mods can remove it.
* I recommend using websites like [saucenao.com](https://saucenao.com/) | [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) | [Tineye](https://tineye.com/) to search for your joke first, but it is NOT required.
* Send a modmail if you have any other rule suggestions/questions.

3. **RUMORS/LEAKS** - News or information about upcoming movies or shows should be regarded as spoilers, if not officially confirmed by Marvel Studios.

###2. Be Civil
1. Respect the opinions of others and treat them with dignity without regard to their **gender**, **race**, **political beliefs**, **religion**, **appearance**, or **sexual orientation**. Insulting, harassing, threatening, or acting rudely towards other users will not be tolerated and can result in the removal of your comment and a temporary or permanent ban.
2. Film, television, and media is subjective. Differing opinions are to be expected.

###3. No Reposts
1. Reposts include, but are not limited to **news**, **articles**, **trailers**, **posters**, **videos**, or **images** that have already been submitted and discussed on *the front page* in the last six months.

###4. No Low Effort Posts
1. Low effort posts include, but are not limited to:
2. • Low effort image macros, memes, or reaction images

2025-10-19 15:04:39,209 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - subscribers 2383061
2025-10-19 15:04:39,210 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description # 1. Feel free to speak your mind 

* This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.

# 2. Do not break sitewide rules

* Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.

* Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will be removed.

* Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.

* Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.

# 3. Posts must be on topic

Posts should be personalized and written in an off my chest style.

Posts here should not be:

* Opinions, generalisations and blanket statements.

* Questions, surveys or polls.

* Requests for relationship advice.

* Political themed posts/comments/discussions.

* Rage bait, obviously fake stories and trolling attempts.

* Complaining about or linking to other subreddits and users

* Overly descriptive NSFW,fan fiction and fetish bait

If you're unsure that your post qualifies as personal, message the mods and ask.

* More information on what types of posts are allowed here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/

# 4. Comments must be civil and respectful of OP

* Any comment that could be interpreted as an attempt to insult, scold, lecture, victim blame, guilt trip or intimidate the OP are not allowed and will be removed. Repeat offenses or extreme cases will result in a ban.

# 5. Be mature 

* No off-topic comments. Civil debates only, name calling and anger are not appropriate here.

* Please engage the community in good faith and do not test the limits of the mod team.

# 6. Do not disclose personal information about yourself or others 

* Do not reveal personally identifiable information. Consider creating a new reddit account just for your post.

* Do not attempt a witch hunt. This includes referencing another user's reddit history.

* Do not ping users who are not already in the thread. Pinging someone in order to harass them is a bannable offense

# 7. Posts must be personal and in "off my chest" style

* If your post isn't personal in nature or in "off my chest" style, it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.

# 8. No financial transactions

* Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offensive with zero tolerance.

# 9. Updates must be posted in a reasonable manner

1. **Be weird**
    * The point of the subreddit is something that is **weird**. It is not a substitute for "what is X", AI generated content, artwork "you" made subreddits.

1. **No Spam**
    * No spam. Stop selling your fabulous products or services here. If they were that fabulous, you wouldn't be so desperate.

1. **No Porn**
  * Yes, your dick is weird. Yes, your fetishes are weird. While that may be objectively true, we do not wish to have that content here. 

1. **No Gore**
   * Well it certainly is kind of weird to see a guy split in half in the middle of the road reaching out for a final moment of human connection and instead they are surrounded by people with cellphones taking videos of the event. But we do not want that here. 

4. **Don't be an asshole**
   * Try to be nice to your fellow redditors and also keep your shitty bigoted opinions mostly to yourself. Just because your mom won't find out you said the n-word doesn't mean you should do it.

5.  Posts must link to sites on our [approved list](/r/Weird/wiki/index).

**[Meta] posts** | If you are inquiring about post removals, rule violations, etc., you must use mod-mail; any private messages to a subreddit moderator about moderation will be ignored. You can submit a meta post about post removals, rule violations, etc. only if your inquiry does not receive a response in modmail within 48 hours.

**No Fake News**  |/r/SquaredCircle has a very strict policy towards troll rumors (fake injury reports, releases, etc.) and those responsible for posting them are subject to being banned.
**Moderator Discretion** | At any time the moderators will use discretion on any given rule. If they feel it's significant or unique to be up despite the rules. On the other hand, they also reserve the right to remove any post they feel breaks the rules. All of this can of course be appealed by messaging us.

1. **Be civil and don't be a jerk.**

3. **Your post must fit the subreddit.**
Posts should have a confusing element or an unexpected twist and must make you go "hold up wait a minute."

4. **No Politics or Social Issues**
No Political posts (to include world politics). We want humor and comedy, not "I hate this political figure, social group, or social issue." No outrage or rage bait posts.

5. **No NSFW/Nudity.**
We don't allow nudity/porn. If we allow it, we will be de-listed from r/all and r/popular. Take it elsewhere.

6. **No Blatant Reposts.**
If your post was recently submitted to r/HolUp by you or some other user within the last 3 months it will be removed.

7. **Moderator Discretion.**
The moderators reserve the right to remove any post or comment at our discretion even if it does not break the above rules.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,360 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ##About \/r/Comics

&gt; This subreddit is for everything related to print comics and web comics.  Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.


##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)

&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.
2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. 
3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.
4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.
5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. 
6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  
7. **[Cite Sources.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_7._cite_sources)** - If your comic is a direct adaptation of an existing joke, tweet, post or meme, please cite the original source in the comments.

##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)

&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.
* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.
* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  
* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.
* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.

##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)

&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to "fix" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.
* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.
* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.


##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)

&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their "Original Content." Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.

Here is a little more about us.
 
We are looking for **lighthearted, fun** and **interesting** UK-specific content and comments 
***


This subreddit is a place for banter, jokes rambling discussions as the users see fit - however please bear in mind that we are a community with a goal of growing discussion without the following creeping in:

- Hate speech, aggression, racism. You're better than that
- Politics. This is a blanket policy. Please do not bring politics, politicians or political events into the subreddit - you *will* receive a ban. Try /r/UKPolitics instead.   
- Negativity about the source of a story just because you don't like the source.
- General low-effort moans. We have /r/BritishProblems for this.
 

For current event threads, news and discussion please use /r/UnitedKingdom

2025-10-19 15:04:39,376 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description All things Generation Y (Millennials).

Millennials are the generation that were born between 1981 to 1996. Our generation comes after Gen X, and before Gen Z.

Check out our sister subreddit, /r/Zillennials. As well as r/decadeology for more in depth cultural analysis. 

Zillennials are the micro-generation between Gen Z and Millennials, years ~1994-1999. Join the discord server here --&gt; https://discord.gg/Se8Nr5JMbU

All generations are welcome to post &amp; comment.

****

Rules:

- Treat Others Like A Human Being
Basically, just be cool, and you'll avoid 90% of potential problems. Remember that, with exception of bots/spam, you are talking to a human on the other end, and you should talk to that person as you would in real life.

- No Discrimination, Mud Slinging, or Hate Speech
Direct mistreatment of users for their race, religion, sexuality, and other forms of discrimination are strictly prohibited. Politics are allowed but only for talking about in a civil manner.

- No Personal Attacks or Harrassment
Do not personally attack others, harass others, stalk others, or leak their personal information (Doxxing).

- No Spamming or Low-Level Content
Any instances of spamming, trolling, clearly repetitive content, overtly low-level content, and negatively provocative content will be removed. This is to maintain user experience and to keep the subreddit running smoothly.

- Subreddit Content Should Lean Towards Positive or Nostalgia Focused Discussion
Mostly this serves as a guideline but the content on this subreddit should be more geared towards Millennial nostalgia and the positive aspects of our generation.

- No NSFW Content
Do not post gore, nudity, pornography, links to NSFW sites, etc.

- No Personal Information
Do not share another person's personal information. Anything you share about yourself you share at your own risk. Always keep the safety of yourself and others in mind.

- No Gatekeeping
All forms of gatekeeping will be deleted and the perpetrator will be warned. Further gatekeeping will result in a ban on the perpetrator. It's fine to discuss differences and observations in a civil manner.

- No Discussing Definitions / "What Generation am I?" / "When do Millennials start and end?" / "Who is considered a Millennial?" posts
This has been discussed countless times already. Otherwise, you're free to discuss whatever it is on r/generationology or r/decadeology.

- No "surveys" / "data" posts
This is a recurring theme of past posts, questions about "What do Millennials see in a brand?" or "What are your opinions on _____ brand" are not allowed. There are plenty of other research subreddits for these types of posts.

- No Politics
Our community is **not** r/politics or r/antiwork. For these types of discussions please use other subs. This rule has been implemented to avoid toxic users and discussions here. This may be lifted in the future at some point.

- No discussion of Palestinian v. Israeli conflict.
There are countless different subs to discuss this controversial event happening. To curb repetitive and toxic posts we are NOT allowing this topic here.

## Asking debugging questions

If you need help debugging, you must include:

1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].
2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.
4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that illustrates your problem.
5. The output you expected, and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.

See [debugging question guidelines][debugging] for more info.
  
## Asking conceptual questions

Many conceptual questions have already been asked and answered. Read our [FAQ][faq] and search old posts before asking your question. If your question is similar to one in the FAQ, explain how it's different. 

See [conceptual questions guidelines][conceptual] for more info.

## Subreddit rules

### 1. No unprofessional/derogatory speech

- Follow [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette): behave professionally and civilly at all times. Communicate to others the same way you would at your workplace. Disagreement and technical critiques are ok, but personal attacks are not.

  Abusive, racist, or derogatory comments are absolutely not tolerated. 

  See our [policies on acceptable speech and conduct](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_acceptable_speech_and_conduct) for more details.

### 2. No spam or tasteless self-promotion

- When posting some resource or tutorial you've made, you must follow our [self-promotion policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_self-promotion).

  In short, your posting history should not be predominantly self-promotional and your resource should be high-quality and complete. Your post should not "feel spammy".

  Distinguishing between tasteless and tasteful self-promotion is inherently subjective. When in doubt, message the mods and ask them to review your post.

  Self promotion from first time posters without prior participation in the subreddit is explicitly forbidden.

### 3. No off-topic posts

- Do not post questions that are completely unrelated to programming, software engineering, and related fields. Tech support and hardware recommendation questions count as "completely unrelated".

  Questions that straddle the line between learning programming and learning other tech topics are ok: we don't expect beginners to know how exactly to categorize their question. 

  See our [policies on allowed topics](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_allowed_topics) for more details.

### 4. Do not ask exact duplicates of FAQ questions

- Do not post questions that are an exact duplicate of something already answered in the [FAQ](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq).

  If your question is similar to an existing FAQ question, you MUST cite which part of the FAQ you looked at and what exactly you want clarification on.

### 5. Do not delete posts

- Do not delete your post! Your problem may be solved, but others who have similar problems in the future could benefit from the solution/discussion in the thread. 

  Use the "solved" flair instead.

### 6. No app/website review requests or showcases

- Do not request reviews for, promote, or showcase some app or website you've written. This is a subreddit for learning programming, not a "critique my project" or "advertise my project" subreddit.

  Asking for code reviews is ok as long as you [follow the relevant policies](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_asking_for_a_code_review). In short, link to only your code and be specific about what you want feedback on. Do not include a link to a final product or to a demo in your post.

### 7. No rewards

- You may not ask for or offer payment of any kind (monetary or otherwise) when giving or receiving help.

  In particular, it is not appropriate to offer a reward, bounty, or bribe to try and expedite answers to your question, nor is it appropriate to offer to pay somebody to do your work or homework for you.

### 8. No indirect links

- All links must link directly to the destination page. Do not use URL shorteners, referral links or click-trackers. Do not link to some intermediary page that contains mostly only a link to the actual page and no additional value.

  For example, linking to some tweet or some half-hearted blog post which links to the page is not ok; but linking to a tweet with interesting replies or to a blog post that does some extra analysis is.

  Udemy coupon links are ok: the discount adds "additional value".

### 9. Do not promote illegal or unethical practices

- Do not ask for help doing anything illegal or unethical. Do not suggest or help somebody do something illegal or unethical. 

  This includes piracy: asking for or posting links to pirated material is strictly forbidden and can result in an instant and permanent ban.

  Trying to circumvent the terms of services of a website also counts as unethical behavior.

### 10. No complete solutions

- **Do not** ask for or post a complete solution to a problem.

  When working on a problem, try solving it on your own first and ask for help on *specific* parts you're stuck with.

  If you're helping someone, focus on helping OP make *forward progress*: link to docs, unblock misconceptions, give examples, teach general techniques, ask leading questions, give hints, but no direct solutions.

  See our [guidelines on offering help](/r/learnprogramming/wiki/index#wiki_offering_help) for more details.

### 11. Don't ask to ask.

   - Ask your questions right here in the open subreddit. Show what you have tried and tell us exactly where  you got stuck.

   We want to keep all discussion inside the open subreddit so that more people can chime in and help as well as benefit from the help given.

   We also do not encourage help via DM for the same reasons - that more people can benefit

### 12. Low Effort Questions

   - **Do not ask** easily googleable questions or questions that are covered in the documentation.

   This subreddit is not a proxy for documentation or google.

   We do require effort and demonstration of effort.

   This includes "how do I?" questions

### 13. No AI (chatGPT etc.) generated/worked over messages/comments. No questions about chatGPT/AI generated code. No Vibe coding.

   - Such posts/comments will be removed without warning and the poster of ai generated content will be instantly banned.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,406 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **Welcome to r/Scams, a subreddit for all your scam identification needs!**
               

* This is a help forum - bad advice will get you banned, and we do not consider "just joking" to be a defense of advice that would be harmful if followed.

&amp;nbsp;

---


**Posting guidelines**:

* You should post details in order to receive quick advice. Include details like: what the person sent you, details included in texts/emails/in-person conversation, etc. The more detail, the better. If you post screenshots, you should also copy and paste the text from the screenshot into your post so that the text shows up on Google and other search engines. Make sure you redact all personal information from your screenshots.

* Given the nature of this subreddit, you should treat any external links as suspicious, and you should be careful visiting any unfamiliar websites. 

* Don't post links to websites you think are scams. Put the website address in the title of your post, so it's safe for everyone.

&amp;nbsp;

---

**Posting rules:** 


* **Rule 1: Be civil** - Please ensure that all your posts and comments in this subreddit are civil and use appropriate and respectful language at all times. Flaming, name-calling, bullying, harassment, or anything else that could break site-wide rules or offend or disturb others is prohibited. Regardless of whether a scam has been posted here once or a thousand times, remember there is a real person behind the screen. We are a landing page for people new to Reddit, and people in crisis. Be kind, not snarky.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 2: Report recovery scammers** - Anyone suggesting contact via DM, or the services of a professional hacker to help recover funds must be reported. Remember: never take advice in private, because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 3: No personal information** - Sharing personal information is strictly forbidden in this subreddit. Offending posts will be immediately removed. Please censor any personal information in posts and comments. This includes phone numbers, addresses, photos, and full names. The exception to this rule is people who present themselves as public figures (ex: celebrities, internet personalities, etc.)

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 4: No spam** - This subreddit is a place for meaningful and useful discussions about scams. Nonsensical and useless content, memes, advertisements, solicitation, or any other spammy, off-topic content is not allowed. Sarcasm doesn't fly: we don't allow jokes on serious posts. Posts asking to verify online stores should be submitted to other topic-specific subreddits. If you don't know where: r/findareddit

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 5: No low effort posts** - Low-effort posts will be removed. Please ensure that all posts posted to this subreddit are of decent quality and on-topic. Screenshots without transcripts, links to external articles with no information in the body of your post, link posts to outside websites, memes, jokes, or anything else that isn't useful is not allowed.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 6: No uncensored nudity or photos of dead people** - Don't post nudity without censoring it. Don't upload photos of dead people without censoring them, regardless of the NSFW tag. All NSFW posts will be queued for moderation, so be patient.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 7: No personal army requests** -  We are not your personal army. You cannot request members of the sub to mass report accounts, mass text/call phone numbers, or otherwise use our large sub for your own personal gain.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 8: No private message requests** -  Don't ask for contact via private message. We need to keep the community safe from recovery scammers or bad advice. Remember: never take advice in private, because we can't look out for you. If you take advice in private, you're on your own.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 9: No scambaiting** - This is a scam identification subreddit. Scambaiting, interacting with known scammers or anything that encourages wasting scammers' time, etc, on posts and comments, is not encouraged or allowed. Scambaiting can be dangerous and is best left to the professionals. Additionally, we do not permit referrals to sites or subreddits that promote or encourage scambaiting.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 10: No self promotion** - We are not the platform to advertise your business, your Youtube, your social media channels, or other self-serving ventures. This includes referral links.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 11: No promoting illegal activities** -  Do not promote illegal transactions, hacks, scams, recovery services, or other dangerous/illegal items or activities.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 12: No research requests or media requests without moderator approval** - Given the nature of our subreddit and the risk of scammers, you cannot post a survey, a call for participants for a news story, or other research/writing opportunities without moderator approval. This is especially the case if you are collecting personal information from sub members for an article or for university/work research. A tag will be added to approved posts.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 13: No scammers** - We are not a subreddit to promote your scams.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 14: No begging or crowdfunding links** - We do not permit requests for money, donations, wishlist purchases, etc. in this sub. This includes (but is not limited to) Gofundme campaigns, Bitcoin wallet addresses, or Venmo/Cashapp requests.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Rule 15: Keep it safe** - Everybody should strive to make r/Scams a safe place. Bad advice should be reported to the mods, not only downvoted. Clickable links to scam websites are not allowed. We favor putting website addresses in the titles of posts. Moderators will use their discretion to prevent users from posting something that may be harmful for themselves or the community. We also heavily moderate posts by underage users, for their protection.

##Rules:

###1. Post must include a clever comeback
* It has to be a great response (preferably *clever*) to someone. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule1)

###2. No reposts
* Do not repost content that hit the front page on this or other subreddits. Front page reposts can lead to a ban, and all other reposts will be removed. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule2)

###3. We enforce quality control
* If your post doesn't fit the standards of this sub, or is just generally an eyesore, it could be removed. This is at moderator discretion. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule3)

###4. No circle-jerking
* If some politician tweets something incredibly stupid, or another youtuber poses with a dead guy, there will be a flood of posts about it on this subreddit. We may remove or ban posts pertaining to it during that time, depending on how many posts there are, and how popular they've gotten. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule4)

###5. No racism/sexism/homophobia
* Bigotry is NOT tolerated on this subreddit. Do not post things that are racist/sexist/homophobic. Depending on the content, you may receive a ban, and your comment/submission will be removed. Again, you're not going to run up against this rule unless you attempt to do so. 

* **IF** a submission is a comeback due to someone being racist, that *may* be accepted. Otherwise, there is zero tolerance. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule5)


###6. No Doxxing/brigading

##Rules

#####1. Be Respectful.

&gt; Respect other people's opinions and views. If you get into debates or arguments it's fine, but maintain respect and avoid toxicity and insults. Posts/comments that contain insults or incite toxicity against anyone will be removed. No Vagueposting.

#####2. Keep it on Topic.

&gt; Keep all posts on topic of Genshin Impact leaks. Please make sure comments stay on the topic of the post itself. Excessive negativity and complaints on posts, even if tangentially related, is not permitted.

&gt; Any spam, advertising, personal speculation, questions, self-promotion, etc. is not allowed and will be removed. "Official" content IS allowed.

#####3. Keep general discussion and questions to the megathread.

&gt; Keep general discussion and questions to the megathread.

#####4. No NSFW.

&gt; Any NSFW submissions, comments, or flairs that contain nudity or sexual activities will be removed.

#####5. No controversial topics

&gt; This includes religion, politics, or anything that causes issues or discomfort for others.

#####6. Mark Spoilers

&gt; When submitting posts mark any new archon quest content, unreleased quest/lore, unreleased areas, or any potential spoilers as such. If you are unsure, mark it as a spoiler anyways. Do not include spoilers in the title. 

&gt; Comments in both Megathreads and leak posts must also include spoiler tags if the leak post the user is referencing is spoiler tagged. Please follow the proper bracket format as indicated in the Megathread post to clarify the topic of your comment containing said spoilers.

&gt; Spoiler rule applies to other media too, such as other games, recently released movie or an ongoing tv series

#####7. Sourcing

&gt; When possible, credit the original poster of the leak in the title and leave the URL for the original post in the comments.

#####8. English translation required

&gt; All posts, if not already in English, must have an English translation in the post itself. It must be in the post itself; if it's an image it can either be superimposed on the image next to the original text or in the image description. It cannot be in the comments.

#####9: Showcases

&gt; Please ensure the following when making a showcase post:

&gt; Make sure the video does not contain any music from a 3rd party, as this will make it more likely to be auto flagged and removed. Please resubmit the video without this music. If the video has music already, please submit it as muted.

&gt; Ensure the showcase contains upcoming characters or content., and use your best judgement to ensure the showcase is meaningful enough to warrant a separate post. This will be judge on a case by case basis.

####Rules

1) **Posts must be about personal finance in Canada**

No career advice, job hunting, employment negotiation, "should I move", housing price complaints, venting about tipping, "what is the salary for...", politics, random ranting, whining, etc. This extends to asking for recommendations of professionals to help with your finances. Illegal activity will be removed. The flairs exist for general categorization. If you have an issue with a product/service from an institution, contact them first to resolve before posting here.

2) **Be helpful and respectful**

Be helpful and respectful in your comments. No need to insult degrade or be offensive to others. 

3) **Avoid Surveys and Self-promotion**

This includes solicitation of referrals, posting your own blog, video channel or personal website, surveys to gather data, and recommendations for users to do business with you. Do not ask others about their own personal circumstances e.g. "what would you do" and/or "what are you doing for x?" We expect that users do not use this forum to build a brand, for financial gain, or to attempt to gain traffic or users. This also extends to PM'ing users because of comments they made on this subreddit.

4) **All specific investment recommendations/requests will be removed** 
CRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED. Broad funds/ETFs, or discussion of investment concepts would still generally be allowed. Pushing particular investments without mentioning risk tolerance, timeline, use for the funds, etc, will be removed. Inquiries around specific funds and/or investment strategies should be directed to r/CanadianInvestor.

5) **IamAs/AMAs must be approved by mods**

If you'd like to host an "I Am A/Ask Me Anything" (IamA/AMA) thread, you must first [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPersonalFinanceCanada) for approval. We will evaluate if your topic is suitable for the subreddit and will set a date to avoid conflicts. Unapproved AMAs may be removed without notice at the moderator's discretion.

6) **We expect that posts about crypto posted in this community PRIMARILY fit in with this community** Asking about Canada specific crypto taxation, rules, and other crypto topics would still be allowed, as the discussion resulting from it would be primarily Canada personal finance focused. CRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED.

####Posting guidelines

**Include your province in your post!**

**Include sources.**

A good answer will be supported by relevant and reliable sources. Answers that link only to your personal blog or website are considered low-quality and may be removed at the moderators' discretion.

**Have an in-depth answer.**

Use a mix of context, explanation, and sources in your answer. Do not just post links to other sites as an answer. If you do believe a source fully answers a question then consider including a quote from the source. 

**Be inquisitive, and clear if you are unsure.**

If you have heard or read something which might be related to the question, and you want to check it, then make sure you ask it as a question. Do not post "I'm not sure if this is true..." or "Someone will correct me if I'm wrong." If you're not actually answering the question, then make sure your comment looks like a question.

Content Philosophy
=

Content which benefits the **community** (news, rumors, and discussions) is valued over content which benefits only the **individual** (technical questions, help buying/selling, rants, etc.).  This fundamental difference in audience is why we support two communities, [r/Apple](/r/apple) and [r/AppleHelp](/r/applehelp).  If you'd like to view their content together, click [here](/r/apple+applehelp).

## [- Subreddit Rules -](/r/books/wiki/rules)[- Message the mods -](http://goo.gl/HXpfgH)[Related Subs](/r/books/wiki/relatedsubreddits)[AMA Info](/r/Books/wiki/amarules)[The FAQ](/r/books/wiki/faq) [The Wiki](/r/books/wiki/index)

This is a moderated subreddit. It is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage in-depth discussion about all things related to books, authors, genres or publishing in a safe, supportive environment. If you're looking for help with a personal book recommendation, consult our [Suggested Reading](/r/books/wiki/suggested) page or ask in: /r/suggestmeabook

# Quick Rules:

1. **Discussion is the goal**  
Do not post shallow content. All posts must be directly book related, informative, and discussion focused. 

2. **Personal conduct**  
Please use a civil tone and assume good faith when entering a conversation.

3. **Prohibited**  
Promotional posts, comments &amp; flairs, media-only posts, personalized recommendation requests incl. ‘Should I read …?’, ‘What’s that book?’ posts, sales links, piracy, plagiarism, low quality book lists, unmarked spoilers (instructions for spoiler tags are in the sidebar), sensationalist headlines, novelty accounts, low effort content. *Please see extended rules for appropriate alternative subreddits, like /r/suggestmeabook, /r/whatsthatbook, etc. or check out our [Related Subreddits](/r/books/wiki/relatedsubreddits).*

4. **Encouraged**  
We love *original* content and self-posts! Thoughts, discussion questions, epiphanies and interesting links about authors and their work. We also encourage discussion about developments in the book world and we have a flair system. 

5. **Important**  
We don't allow personal recommendation posts. You can ask in our Weekly Recommendation Thread, consult our [Suggested Reading](/r/books/wiki/suggested) or [What to Read](/r/books/wiki/whattoread) page, or post in /r/suggestmeabook.

6. **[Click here for the extended rules](/r/Books/wiki/rules)**  
Please report any comment that does not follow the rules and remember that mods have the final say.

*****

**Rules &amp; Guidelines**

**1) Respect Other Users**

Please respect the opinions and posts of other users that fall within the content policy. Report rulebreaking instead of arguing in the replies. Please do not tell other users how to raise their pets. Do not tell people to keep their cats indoors or to spay/ neuter them.

Follow the sitewide terms of service as well as reddiquette.

**2) Spam, memes, ads, self promotion &amp; karma farming**

We prefer original content. Content found online is not directly prohibited, but we discourage karma farming. This includes titles &amp; posts that suggest a cat found online is owned by you.

Please do not post memes or image macros. 

We do not allow fundraisers or self-promotion of any kind. We do not allow advertising of any sort.

This includes accounts that primarily exist to promote their own NSFW content. NSFW/onlyfans posters are allowed to participate here, but on a separate SFW account..

**3) No NSFW, animal abuse, or cruelty**

No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty. 

No dead animal photos. While we understand you may be mourning, please do not share photos of your cat after passing. Photos during their lifetime are fine. 

We understand that hunting is a natural behaviour but ask that you don't share photos of your cats prize here.

**4) Recent/Egregious repost**

Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma.

**5) Disallowed topics**

We no longer allow people to ask what breed or gender their cat is.

We do not allow political or politically charged posts. 

**6) 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but require the correct flair + verification to ensure OC.**

You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule.

**7) No personal information**

Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back) (Rule 7).

**8) No meme, image macro, low-effort content. AI generated content is considered low effort and is a bannable offense.**

Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content.

**The moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't follow or post it. Go see a vet! Please do not give medical advice to posters if you are not a medical professional with experience treating cats.**

Some of these rules are based upon [Reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), [Reddit's TOS](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).

- If you are posting the same sources more than 1/10 times, we will start to consider it as spam.  We take into account your posts to all of Reddit, not just r/PS5. 

- Constant posting of the sources that you are directly affiliated with (particularly news rehash blogs) is considered self-promotion spam and will result in a ban.

- This is not limited to your own content, you can be in violation of the rules by posting content you are not directly affiliated with. If you violate this rule repeatedly, you and the website/channel may be banned.

- This rules does not apply to official Sony or PlayStation media sources.

##Media Posting
**By default, all media posting will be turned off to reduce the influx of memes, box pics and spam. ** 

- For posting of images, gifs or videos (directly or otherwise) we will only turn this method of posting on during special occasions. This includes events such as highly anticipated releases and conferences.

- Consider r/PlayStation for sharing general media content with the community. 

##Events 
**During events such as the State of Play, the subreddit will go on “restricted mode”.**
 
- Creating new posts will be turned off. Only mods and approved users will be able to make new posts. Typically, there will be a pinned “info and discussion” thread linking to the individual threads created. The sub is usually on restricted mode roughly 30mins before the event is slated to start. The sub will be turned off restricted mode after all the threads are created and organized in the pinned thread.

- Additionally, during high traffic periods, particularly for State of Play or Showcase events, self posts will be restricted temporarily with discussion encouraged in the megathreads posted.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,493 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ## Rules

1. **Only "ThatsInsane" content**. This subreddit is for things that are a little bit more wild, crazy, terrifying and incredible than the average. And for stuff that is generally insane! Fake content does not qualify as "Insane content". Think before submitting, would I find this post "ThatsInsane" if it would be someone else who posted it. Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of "ThatsInsane" from viewers.

2. **No racism, bigotry, hate speech, inciting violence, etc**. This includes, but is not limited to, Racism, hate speech, bigotry, homophobia, islamophobia, and incivility will be removed and the poster will be banned. Do not in any way attempt to incite violence, hate based on identity directly or indirectly, you will get banned. We will be enforcing the [reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) and reddit's [official rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules), so you need to obey them.

3. **No pornography, overly gore, or disturbing material**. Examples of what can count as "overly gore/disturbing material" include stabbing, shooting, rape, serious injuries, children getting hurt, animal abuse, nasty things, and other content that contains scenes with a lot of blood..

4. **Moderator Discretion**. Posts are at the discretion of the moderators. If we do not believe it fits the sub, or think it is spam, we will remove it.

5. **Repost Guidelines**. This is only for reposts that have been posted to /r/ThatsInsane recently, is in top of all time or have been posted so often on reddit that the majority of users have seen this content. Quasi-reposts may also be removed per mod discretion.

6. **Claims must be sourced in comments**. Posts with claims must have a linked and credible source that backs up the information. OP is the one responsible for this and it must be provided at time of posting. Also misleading information will be removed.

7. **Use descriptive titles**. Non-descripted titles will be removed. Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. "insane" or "this is crazy" is not a proper description.


8. **No violence**. No violence, so no fights or injuries that **are not very very minor**. This obviously includes death posts, those are strictly forbidden.

9. **No serious crimes**. No lootings, rape or other serious crimes. Don’t post something and *directly* or *indirectly* say ”this person commited this crime” or showing someone committing a **serious** crime.

10. **Avoid rage-bait posts/comments**. Avoid rage-bait posts. Some posts may be allowed per moderator discretion. A rage-bait post can include, but is not limited to, protests that usually leads to a lot of inciting violence and hate based on identity in the comments, or islamophobia, homophobia etc, will be removed per this rule. Frequent offenders will be banned. The issue is that users exploit loopholes by posting rage-bait comments and posts to indirectly promote hate or incite violence, without actually doing it themselves.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,527 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **Welcome to Personal Finance for the Financially Challenged!**

**Important: Please [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/rules) before posting or commenting!**

They can also be found below.

1) Be civil and respectful

2) Off-topic posts will be removed. 

3) All content must be legal, ethical, and moral. Posts advocating theft, or practices that in any way exploit or harm others (criminal or not) will be removed.

4) This is not a place for politics, but rather a place to get advice on daily living and short-to-midterm financial planning. Political advocacy, debate, or grandstanding will be removed.

5) Racism, sexism, classism/poor-shaming, or any other inherent bias will not be tolerated. Any comments/posts stating or implying that the reason that people are poor is because of personal decision making or that people in poverty "deserve" to be in poverty will be removed. 

6) No judgment on how people got to where they are at. Regardless of if someone was simply born into poverty, or earned it through drug use, criminal activity, gambling, having a lot of kids, working for LuLaRoe, etc. We're focused on the road forward, not the past.

7) No gatekeeping. This sub is for anyone who self identifies as struggling financially or as financially insecure.

8) Advice and comments must be in good faith. Anything that appears to be a scam, predatory, or downright dangerous will be removed. This includes most "get rich quick" schemes, including cryptocurrency which is too risky/volatile to be an investment for people with limited incomes.

9) Links to websites outside of Reddit: The titles of these posts must have clear, accurate titles, misleading or vague titles will be removed. URL shorteners are not permitted. Referral links, or links to your own content (whether monetized or not) are permitted. You need to disclose if you have an affiliation with a site or service you are linking to. You must disclose referral links and provide a non-ref link as well, no exceptions! During the Holidays, referral links are not permitted as the sub becomes inundated with them.

10) No soliciting, offering, or accepting public or private donations, loans, or crowdsourcing.  All aid given must be in the form of information or advice. For financial donations please check out sites like r/donation r/charity and /r/randomactsofkindness 

11) Unsolicited advice must be generally respectful of people's right to determine their own values, free of assumptions and judgments, and in otherwise fitting with the rules, guidelines, and spirit of the sub. This includes posts flaired as "Vent/Rant" where any advice/judgment is prohibited as these are reserved as posts where users can simply express themselves. 

[Check out our Wiki for general useful information!](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index)

Much of the financial advice online and on reddit is aimed at people who have varying degrees of disposable income, ability to invest, lots of free time, available transportation, no kids, a partner, access to credit, and beyond.   This is a place for people who do not have a lot, nor ideal circumstances, to help each other get by and hopefully move up in the world.  

You do not have to be absolutely destitute to be here.  Whether you are a single parent only pulling 10k a year, or a single person trying to get past student loans at 28K, you are welcome here.  The goal here is to help anyone who doesn't have a lot of breathing room get to a place where they have stability, comfort, contingency, and maybe even a little luxury.  


**Wiki**

We have a comprehensive sub wiki that can help with most poverty-related topics that you can access here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/wiki/index

If you have suggestions/recommendations for additional content/topics please let the mods know!


**Guidelines**

* At this time there are not a lot of restrictions on what kind of topics or items can be posted here, so as long as it relates to getting by when you don't have much feel free.  Overtime we if/as the community develops we might start to rein in the scope this sub features.

* Answer the questions asked and stay on topic.  If someone asks for advice on how to 'buy' a cheap oil change, don't reply with "Just do it yourself".  


**Purpose**

 The sub is not for a single financial goal, but rather to help people with a range of goals.  This may include but is not limited to:  

* Learning to live within one's means
* Achieving a positive earning to expense ratio 
* Reducing debt and building savings 
* Moving to a better paying job
* Cutting expenses 
* Spending smarter 
* Living a better life on the same budget 
* Working smarter, not harder 
* Planning for upcoming expenses, purchases, adventures 
* Finding qualifying benefits.  

This is not a one-size-fits all venture, so please be respectful of what other people might be looking for.  We are here to help each other achieve their needs and wants, not to judge their priorities.  We get enough judgment from people who do not know our situation all the time, this sub will respect people's right to live their lives on their terms, not condemn them from afar.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,529 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description Welcome to r/geography!

Geography is the study of the earth and its features, inhabitants, and phenomena, and goes far beyond simple location identifications on a map or general trivial information such as capitol and country names.

Geographers have a special understanding about the Earth and global systems and use analytical skills and applied methods to answer questions about human and physical phenomena. In short, geographers are particularly good at determining the "Why of Where."

**Submission Guidelines**

[Please read the rules before posting!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/about/rules/)

Discussions of all branches and scales of geography are highly encouraged! If you have a question, no matter how basic or complex, ask away.

Assigning a post flair is required.

Links to original sources are preferred.

Please do not re-host images or maps at imgur or similar sites. Re-hosting prevents the author(s) from getting the recognition they deserve. It also prevents us, the reader, from seeing the context and background information the image was published in.

Original work is welcome. If you've created a map using real-world data, or written an article or blog post etc, please share. Note that fictitious maps and graphics will be removed.

*For geoguessing and challenges, see r/geoguessr, [r/geoguessing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessing/), r/guessthecity, and [r/WWTT](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWTT/)*

*For memes and jokes, see r/geographymemes and r/planningmemes*

*For everything related to flags, see r/vexillology*


**User Flair**

If you have an undergraduate level or higher degree of education in geography or a related field, message the mods to get a custom flair that specifies your specific area of expertise. Otherwise, feel free to add one of our existing flair options for your interest in a specific subfield of geography.

# Rules

1. Be Kind, Civil and Respectful
  - Everyone must be civil and respectful to ensure a healthy and welcoming community. We expect everyone to behave with good intentions and to follow Redditquette.
  - Harassment, bigotry, personal attacks and sharing misinformation will not be tolerated. This includes trolling, baiting, witch-hunting, etc.
  - Constructive criticism must be given tactfully.
  - Retaliation is not tolerated on this subreddit. Disrespect does not excuse further disrespect. Report inflammatory comments and move on.
2. No Piracy
   - Digital piracy will not be tolerated in any shape or form.
   - Posting links to pirated material, encouraging piracy or asking for assistance with pirated content will result in a ban. 
   - This includes sharing/rehosting a mod without the original author’s express permission, as well as linking mods that contain assets illegally ripped from other games/media.
   - Paywalled mods may be discussed but not promoted. Official Bethesda Creations are exempt from this.
3. Tag Your NSFW Content
   - All NSFW content must be accompanied with an NSFW tag.
   - The same goes for posts that reference, advertise or promote NSFW content. 
   - NSFW content unrelated to Skyrim does not belong here and will be deleted. 
   - Content that breaches Reddit guidelines, or is deemed too offensive, will be removed at the moderation team's discretion.
4. No Unrelated Posts or Content
   - All posts and comments must be related to Skyrim modding and on topic. Modding news is welcome.
   - Unrelated material, such as discussions about real-world events, politics, etc. will be removed. 
   - Random Skyrim screenshots, videos and meme posts will be removed. Check the “Related Subreddits” tab for alternatives.
   - Screenshots or videos in the context of asking for help or promoting specific mods are acceptable.
5. Do Your Research
   - To avoid spam, everyone must research their questions before posting, either by reading the subreddit FAQ or doing a Google/subreddit search.
   - Modding guides, recommended mods and answers to common questions can be found in the FAQ.
   - Low-effort questions with no research will be removed. This includes questions like "New modder, what mods should I get?" and "Returning modder, what's new?"
   - Post Guidelines:  
   - * [[Help]](http://tinyurl.com/zrs3mut)
   - * [[Request]](http://tinyurl.com/zezwuyc)
6. Provide Necessary Information
   - When asking for modding assistance you must provide necessary information, e.g. your mod list, ini files and a suitable crash log.
   - All information must be presented in the post itself.
   - You are required to post the above information even if you believe that it is unnecessary.
   - Keep in mind that people are spending their valuable free time helping you! Be kind and show respect.
   - See our [posting rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/posting_rules/#wiki_required_information).
7. No AI-generated posts or comments
  - Beyond the fact that these posts can present misinformation to the reader unintentionally, they are also not an acceptable substitute for thorough, hands-on advice, support, and troubleshooting.
  - We allow the sharing of mods that utilize AI-generated content provided they do not breach any guidelines.
8. Avoid Guessing
  - Posts and comments containing factually and verifiably incorrect statements pertaining to Skyrim and Skyrim modding may be subject to removal.

2025-10-19 15:04:39,557 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **What is a Life Pro Tip?**

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.

**Keep in mind that giving someone advice is not the same as giving someone a LPT.** Advice is offering someone guidance or offering someone a recommendation.

Examples of advice:

 “Always be prepared to leave your employer because they are prepared to leave you.”

“A marriage proposal should not come as a big surprise, despite what you may have seen in the movies.”

2025-10-19 15:04:39,569 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description This subreddit is for all of those recruiters (and candidates!) who really don't... you know... get it.  Post your horror stories and show us those "amazing" job offers!
___

*Rules*:

* Only text posts, screenshots, relevant articles, or archive links allowed. Do not link directly to a recruiting website (e.g., LinkedIn) or job ad.

* Articles are allowed, but must be relevant. Articles meant to sell a company/product ("addicles") are spam and will be treated as such. This includes your "helpful" AI service. 

* Use link flair to tag your posts.

* If your post is lengthy, try to highlight the most humorous areas.  

* Please try to *have* humorous areas.  At least some dark humor or biting sarcasm.

* *Please* be civil. Personal attacks against a person's skills, abilities, or anything else (recruiting-related or otherwise) will lead to disciplinary action. Basically, no namecalling, no insulting people, and no comments like "no wonder you don't have a job". (Note that being polite while namecalling, insulting, and so on is not the same as being civil)

* As an addendum to that, opinions are totally fine, and it's acceptable to have an against the grain opinion. Our subreddit isn't about hate — it's about the annoying recruiting practices and the pain of getting a job. To that end, don't go out of your way to provoke arguments and start fights.

* And as an addendum to *that*, note that using slurs (racist, homophobic, etc... I don't have to spell out every type of slur) or any sort of hate speech is a **one-strike ban.** Encouraging someone to kill themselves is also a one-strike ban, and I can't believe that I have to explicitly tell anyone that.

* No posting of personal information. Please block out all identifying information including personal names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, social media handles, and pictures. Company names may be posted. This is a Reddit-wide rule, not just one for our sub.

* Minor typos or errors are not allowed as the entire point of a post. (e.g., $10/year instead of $10/hour)

* It SHOULD go without saying, but no spam. Spam is defined as any attempt to pitch a product, service, or seek people for jobs (yes, this happens a lot). This includes posts advertising your new AI "solution" to job-hunting problems. Posting spam WILL get you immediately banned (**ONE STRIKE**), and a report will be sent to the Reddit Admins for possible account termination. If you want to advertise on Reddit, [buy ads](http://ads.reddit.com).

* Be mindful of [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439).  (Not posting personal information is also part of Reddiquette)

* Being a dick towards the volunteer mods will get you voluntold off this subreddit. We're just trying to keep the community peaceful, don't make our lives difficult. If your initial reaction to being informed of the rules and asked to tone it down is to turn your rulebreaking up to 11, don't expect to stay here too long. So please don't do that.

Please read our brief [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/wiki/index) if you are still wondering what types of content to post.

 * Posts with "clickbait" titles will be removed.

5. No unrelated submissions.
All content should be clearly relevant to the game of War Thunder and its vehicles.

 * Suggested vehicles must be relevant to War Thunder in terms of time frame and purpose. If there is a vehicle already in-game with similar characteristics, it's probably fine.

This subreddit was created because there was a niche that was not being filled in the historical Reddit community. There was no place to be a redditor in history. All of your historical jokes and memes go here. (This is a place for memes, not propaganda.)

Our Friends (those who promote us are in bold):

* **/r/historyanimemes**
* **/r/animemes**
* **/r/roughromanmemes**
* **/r/redditthroughhistory**
* **/r/shittyaskhistory**
* **/r/LOTRmemes**
* **/r/dankmemesfromsite19**
* **/r/artmemes**
* /r/prequelmemes
* /r/OSP

Remember, this is the memes part of the historical community of reddit, not the historical part of the memes community of reddit. Treat it as such.

Looking for our Discord Server? Scroll down below!

##**RULES:**


**RULE 1: Keep posts history related**

Please keep all submissions to the sub related to history and/or based on historical events. [See here for the extended rules.](https://reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)

All submissions must be as historically accurate as possible.

Ideological memes are not allowed.

**RULE 2: No reposts**

All reposts, similar and identical, of posts previously submitted to the subreddit are banned and eligible for removal.

Rule 2.1

Crossposts are allowed as long as it is not a repost of a previous submission to the subreddit. Crossposts should also be marked with the flair "X-post".
 
**RULE 3: No discrimination or abuse**  

Any excessive sexism, homophobia, racism or any other form of discrimination will be dealt with harshly and mods reserve the right to impose bans without warning. Basically try not to be jerks.

**RULE 4: Year limit**

All posts must include only subject matter of at least 20 years old from the post time. Example: Memes about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers won't be able to be posted till September 2028.

Anniversaries of historical events that are not yet 20 years old are not exempt to this.

Rule 4.1 - Meta use

Posts that either complain about Rule 4 or use Rule 4 as a loophole to circumvent the rule are not allowed on the subreddit.

**RULE 5: Banned Memes and Formats**

Certain memes and formats, such as "Retake the Holy Land" and "Hitler Suicide", are banned on the subreddit. A full list can be found in the extended rules [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/historymemes/wiki/extended_rules)

**RULE 6: Do not deny or defend genocides and atrocities.** 

These include, but are not limited to; Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, Japanese war crimes and the Tiananmen Square massacre. Doing so will result in an instant permaban. Hateful historical revisionists are not welcome.

Do not downplay or use whataboutism in discussion of atrocities and genocides

**RULE 7: No Brigading**

No calling for meme wars or inciting subreddit drama. This includes brigading, raiding, harassing other subreddits and their users, or likewise.

Political talks in comments are okay, but linking to external sites in which are about it are not. Directly linking posts to political subreddits is not allowed unless it is linked in a non-participating manner. [For more info see here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/wiki/intro)

**RULE 8: Post Memes**

All submissions to r/HistoryMemes must be memes. If it's not a meme, post it elsewhere but here. [See here for the extended rules.](https://reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)

Meta memes that pertain to the subreddit are allowed.

**RULE 9: Quality control**

Memes must adhere to some basic standards. Excessive black bars, improper cropping, and low resolution/unreadable memes are banned from the subreddit. [Please see the extended rules here for a full list and explanation on banned practices](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules).

**RULE 10: No karma-whoring**

Memes asking for upvotes, awards, and user actions are not allowed. [See here for the extended rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)  

**RULE 11: No low effort titles**

All submissions to the subreddit must include a proper title that does not exemplify qualities signifying "low-effort", "Lazy", or "Karma-whoring". [See here to see what is prohibited](https://old.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/wiki/extended_rules)   

Rule 11.1

If the title is removed from the meme and it ceases to be either a historical meme or a meme in general it is not allowed on the subreddit.

**RULE 12: No 1900's Onwards on Weekends**

Memes relating to events that occurred from Jan 1st, 1900 onwards, are not allowed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday EST).

Anniversaries of historical events are not exempt to this.

Meta Memes complaining about Rule 12 are (still) prohibited everyday.

Important note: This is not an official Costco subreddit, and does not represent the official stance of Costco Wholesale. Redditors who state that they are employees of the company are not vetted in any way. For official information on Costco, see Costco.com


 
Rule 1. Please refrain from posting an item stock related question or when an item is generally stocked. Instead call your local warehouse(s) to learn about its current availability. 

Rule 2. This Subreddit is not to be utilized as a complaint line of particular warehouses and/or individual employees. You are welcome to voice your concerns and issues you've experienced on your shopping trip but without identifying information. This includes the posting/taking pictures of employees without their permission for the purpose of malicious intent. 

Rule 3: We do not allow posts asking for price checks for “Member Only” items on Costco’s websites. Call your local warehouse if you need assistance. This sub is not the place to request online prices for nonmembers.

Rule 4: Advocating for and/or suggesting the breaking of any of Costco’s outlined membership/employee policies through fraud will result in an immediate and permanent ban.

Rule 5: It is required to post the full item name when creating a merchandise discussion post. Please provide a clear image of the front of the product and one of available nutritional information.
Any additional information (price, item number, warehouse location or region) is also appreciated, but can be added as a separate comment.

Rule 6: This subreddit exists for the sole purpose of the discussion of Costco and its ancillary amenities/services. This is not a subreddit to discuss politics. Please stay on topic as posts violating this rule will be removed. Repeated violations will result in permanent removal from the subreddit.  

Please note: Moderators can remove posts/threads as they see fit outside of the above rules.

&amp;nbsp;

**R1** Be nice 
&gt;No personal attacks against each other, call for violence against anyone, or intentionally antagonize in the comment sections. 
&amp;nbsp;

**R2** Explain incorrect defense articles &amp; takes
&gt;Posts of non-credible takes must be from a "credible" source (news article, politician, or military leader) and must have a comment laying out exactly why it's non-credible. Random social media comments belong in the ‘Low Hanging Fruit’ thread.

**R3** Content must be relevant
&gt;Posts must be about military hardware or international security/defense. No obsessing over Youtube personalities, simping for political leaders, or discussing other areas of international policy.


**R4**  No racism/hatespeech
&gt;No slurs. No advocating for the killing of people or insulting them based on physical, religious, or ideological traits (even people you don't like: Russians, Asians, or Middle Eastern ethnic groups).

**R5** No politics/religion
&gt;We don't care if you're Republican, Protestant, Democrat, Hindu, Baathist, Pastafarian, or some other hot mess. Leave it at the door.

**R6** No seriousposting
&gt;No uncut war footage, fundraisers, credible news articles, etc… The world is already serious enough as it is.
&amp;nbsp;

**R7** No classified material
&gt;Classified 'western' information is off limits regardless of how "open source" and "easy to find" it is.
&amp;nbsp;

**R8** Source artwork
&gt;If you have art in your post; you must provide a direct link to the art's source in the comment section, or a good reason why this was not possible. The source should be a place the artist themselves uploaded the art. A booru or watermark is not a source.
&amp;nbsp;

**R9** No low-effort posts
&gt;No egregiously low effort posts. E.g. screenshots, recent reposts, simple reaction &amp; template memes, and images with the punchline in the title.

**R10** Don't get us banned.
&gt;No brigading or harassing other subreddit pages. Do not post memes with a "haha people that I hate died… haha" punchline or violating the reddit-wide rules.

**R11** Restricted Topics

&gt;The following posts will be automatically removed by the mod team.

&gt;AI-generated Pictures or Text

&gt;Nuclear schizoposting ("doing the funni")

&gt;India/Pakistan posting (If major military action is taken between these two nations, this is automatically removed from R11 for the duration of the conflict)

**R12** Pornographic NSFW content and dead bodies.

&gt;Failure to follow this rule will result in a 30 day ban.

&gt;Use the ‘NSFWaifu’ flair and the SPOILER+NSFW tags for porn posts. Limit of one post every 7 days. No extreme content.

&gt;Posts with dead bodies must use the ‘Literal Death Inside’ flair and the SPOILER+NSFW tags.

**R13**  No misinformation.

&gt; NCD exists to make fun of misinformation, not to spread it. Make outlandish claims, but if your take doesn’t show signs of satire or exaggeration it will be removed. Misleading content may result in a ban. Regardless of source, don’t post obvious propaganda or fake news. Double-check facts and don't be an idiot.

Among us are represented the various reasons to keep data -- legal requirements, competitive requirements, uncertainty of permanence of cloud services, distaste for transmitting your data externally (e.g. government or corporate espionage), cultural and familial archivists, internet collapse preppers, and people who do it themselves so they're sure it's done right. Everyone has their reasons for curating the data they have decided to keep (either forever or For A Damn Long Timetm). Along the way we have sought out like-minded individuals to exchange strategies, war stories, and cautionary tales of failures.

We are one. We are legion. And we're trying really hard not to forget.

###### **Please [spay and neuter](https://www.petsmartcharities.org/adopt-a-pet/find-a-spayneuter-clinic) your pets!** While your newborn pets are cute, failing to do this allows your little darlings to add to the population of homeless animals. Adopt pets from your [local animal rescues/shelters](http://adopt.pschar.org/), there are plenty of animals just waiting for a home.

It is a sex-positive community and a safe space for people of all genders and orientations which demands respectful conduct in all exchanges.  There is **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CREEPY/HARASSING BEHAVIOR here** — in posts, comments, messages, or any other contributions. No exceptions.

**[Rules, Guidelines, Block Unwanted DMs Guide, Other Misc.](https://old.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules)**

**[Wondering why we don't allow certain topics?](https://old.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules/why_dont_we_allow/)**
 
---------------------------------------

This is a large community dedicated to an extremely popular topic.  If you wish to participate, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with our rules of conduct **BEFORE** you participate here.  Failure to do so will result in your removal from the community.  

**PLEASE READ** the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index) with the most asked and answered questions - **BEFORE POSTING!!** Posts that do not follow the posting guidelines in the FAQ will be automatically removed.

--------------------------------------

**THE /R/SEX RULES**

**1) ENGAGE CONSTRUCTIVELY AT ALL TIMES.**   
This means ensuring that ALL of your contributions here are constructive, on-topic, mature, sex-positive, civil and respectful.  Disrespectful conduct will see you banned from the community on the spot.  Hitting on other people, asking for pictures (joking or not), making any sort of sexist comment or insult, body shaming, or trolling of any sort will result in your immediate ban.

**2) DON’T SKIP THE FAQ OR THE FORUM RULES.**  
We’re serious about this. Dozens of posts get removed every day because they’re covered in the FAQ or violate the forum rules.

**3) DON'T OVERLOOK PAST POSTS.**   
We’re serious about this, too. Many questions may be new to you, but are very common in our community. Before you submit a post on a common topic, search the forum.

**4) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE SEX POSITIVE.**   
We demand that consenting adults be free to express their sexuality as they see fit. Kink shaming, slut shaming, and similar conduct will not be tolerated.  Links or references to sex negative communities or websites (No Fap, Porn Free, etc) will not be tolerated.  Attacks on the lifestyle of other consenting adults will not be tolerated.

**5) POSTS SEEK ADVICE, COMMENTS PROVIDE IT.**   
The main forum is focused primarily on posts seeking specific actionable advice for distinctive personal situations. Giving advice should primarily be done in the comments.  General discussions are often allowed, so long as they adhere to the group rules and restricted content guidelines. If you want to make an exception, please request approval from moderators.

**6) DO NOT TROLL OR ENGAGE WITH TROLLS HERE.**   
Don’t try to challenge, question, tease, fight, or outwit trolls here. Instead, use the Report button to alert moderators, who will review every single reported item.  Trolling of any sort merits an immediate permaban.

**7) ALL DISCUSSION MUST BE DIRECTED INTO THE PUBLIC FORUM.** Do not seek private conversations here, via Private Message or any other method. And do not seek to draw attention or clicks to an outside site of any type (unless you have received prior moderator approval, such as for academic research projects). Every comment here must be a clear attempt to engage with an ongoing public discussion in the forum. Violations of this rule will result in permanent bans without notice.

For anyone trying to avoid unwanted DM/chat requests, [here's how to change your settings](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/s/5u3SvkUALf).

**8) RESTRICTED CONTENT** 
This sub is generally only for seeking advice, education, or discussion about sex and sexuality. We restrict or forbid many types of content here.

For expanded definitions of these, please see the full /r/sex rules post.

---------------------------------------

**EXAMPLES OF CONTENT RESTRICTED IN /R/SEX:**

**1) PROMOTIONAL POSTS.**   
This means any post containing any kind of promotional element, especially one which seeks to lure traffic to another site or promote a product. Links to specific product descriptions are permitted if they’re PRECISELY on-topic in the context of the post, AND the post itself is clearly seeking advice in good faith.  If you're trying to sell something, conduct market research, etc - these posts will get you banned.  Linking to sex-positive blogs or podcasts is allowed, provided you make an effort to start a conversation here about the topic and use the link as supporting material.

**2) LINK POSTS.**   
Linked material must be sex positive and precisely on-topic to stay up here, and needs to be introduced with a workable framework for discussion. Please see the posted [Link Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/linkpolicy) **BEFORE** you post links!  Bare links to youtube, images, blogs, podcasts, etc are prohibited.

**3) ACHIEVEMENT POSTS.**   
These include appreciation, humblebrags, “I just had to share,” “I just want to say,” etc. These belong in the Weekly Sexual Achievement Thread, not in the main forum. Posts which are JUST sex stories belong somewhere else entirely — like r/sexstories or a similar forum.  

**4) LOW EFFORT MATERIAL.**    
“Does anyone else...?”, “Is [X] normal/weird?”, “Is [y] wrong/bad/okay?”, and so forth.  Human sexuality is incredibly varied; yes, someone else likes what you like, and labels like "normal" or "weird" are meaningless - and in a sex positive community, we do not allow any moral judgments against sex acts or behaviors that are consensual.  Title-only posts, posts with no effort at an actual conversation will be removed and may get you banned.  Comments that consist of nothing but memes, "this", "lol" and such are highly disfavored.  If comments do not further the discussion, they may be removed; a pattern of these may result in your ban.
   
**5) SEEKING FAP MATERIAL.**   
Do not ask for sex stories, do not ask for the hottest/strangest/most unusual/etc encounter someone ever had.  Do not ask for lists of other people's kinks.  

**6) PORNOGRAPHY, EROTICA, OR PERSONALS.**    
You may not post or link pornography or erotica here.  You may not share pictures of your genitals here - even if you are seeking medical advice (if you need to post a picture, you need to be going to a doctor).  You may not recruit sex partners here, look for dirty chat, ask for someone to private message you, etc.

**7) DISRESPECTFUL CONTENT.**   
Personal attacks, insults, name calling, or disrespect of any sort are not allowed here.  Sexism, racism, or any type of hate speech will result in your immediate ban.  This is a community for **ALL GENDERS** - refusing to acknowledge a trans individual's gender flies in the face of this, and will result in your ban.  

**8) OPINION SEEKING, POLLS, VALUE JUDGEMENTS, OR VALIDATION POSTS.**    
This forum is not for simply collecting opinions - "do you think [X] is hot?", "Women, do you like [Y]?", "What is your favorite sex position?" and so forth.  This is not a forum to discuss your penis size, breast size, labia size, ask about other body image issues, or ask for feedback on your photos.  See the /r/sex FAQ for help regarding body image issues.  Do not post your pictures and ask people to rate or critique you.  Do not ask if given consensual sexual interests are good/bad/okay/wrong, etc.

**9) ACADEMIC SURVEYS.**   
These require prior moderator approval. Moderators will review the question formats and will review the documentation of institutional ethical oversight (please provide). Non-academic surveys are seldom allowed.  Please contact the moderators BEFORE you post a survey or study.  

**10) GENERAL RANTS, ESSAYS, EDITORIALS, VENTS, CONFESSIONS, PSAS, AND AMAS.**    
These don’t belong in the main forum unless you have obtained prior moderator approval. Save them for story-based forums. Or Tumblr.

**11) FREQUENT/FAMILIAR TOPICS.**   
These are addressed in either the FAQ, past posts, or both.  In case you are confused, this means that we **do not do penis size posts here,** nor can we tell if you or your partner are pregnant.  

**12) VAGUE TITLE/TOPIC.**   
If a moderator can’t identify your issue or the type of advice you’re seeking, your post will be subject to removal.  Titles should be at least several words long and adequately express what your post is about.

**13) NONCONSENSUAL OR ILLEGAL CONTENT.**   
/r/sex is for the discussion of consensual sex among adults.  We do not permit posts that advocate pedophilia, bestiality, rape, or incest here under any circumstances, nor do we allow these topics at all in most instances.  Note that BDSM and CNC (consensual nonconsent) are perfectly valid topics in /r/sex.

**14) OTHER OFF TOPIC ISSUES.**    
This is not the place to discuss politics or religion, to seek dating advice, to ask for how to pick up women, to rant about how you have never had sex.  Posts that appear to be dedicated to stirring up arguments - particularly about hot button topics like circumcision, the evils of pornography and/or masturbation, and other toxic subjects - will be removed and will result in swift bans.

A place to find out what that odd-looking thing that you stumbled across actually is. 
***

**Guidelines**
-----------------------------
**GOOGLE your item's description and keywords and do an image search BEFORE POSTING HERE**.
-----------------------------
Then check [**F**REQUENTLY **A**SKED **T**HINGS](/r/WITT_FAT/).  You may not be aware you have a common item.


&gt;**THEN READ [THIS GUIDE](/r/whatisthisthing/wiki/guidelines)** on what to include in your post before posting.

Also, check out our **[WIKI](/r/whatisthisthing/wiki/index).**

&gt;**Rules apply to ALL comments**, not just top level replies. 

1.  **Be civil.**  Being otherwise will get you banned. [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/205926439)

2. **Be helpful / No Jokes** Jokes and other unhelpful comments, even after the item has been identified, are bannable offenses, **even on first offense**.  If your comment doesn't help, don't comment.

3. **Try to include a link** to a source of some sort when posting an answer.  Everyone's got an opinion, facts help.

4. **When what you're looking for is found, reply "Solved!"** to the earliest comment with the answer. 

5. **DO NOT DELETE YOUR POST** after an attempt has been made to answer, or if you intend to repost to get visibility. This will result in at least a temporary ban.

6. **Be detailed** with your post title as well as the information therein, in order to help those trying to help you.  This will help to eliminate vague posts.

7. **Do not post AI generated answers.** AI rarely offers anything of value and never provides sources to its claims. By all means use AI to assist, but please investigate its answers and provide your own proof of its claims. Straight copy/paste answers will be removed and the user banned.

8. **Do not use URL shorteners** or affiliate links in the body of posts or replies ( anything with lots of parameters after a '?') - they will be automatically removed.

9. **Check the F.A.T.** Check the [Frequently Asked Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/WITT_FAT/) before posting.

10. **Posts must adhere to submission guidelines** All posts must adhere to the [submission guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/wiki/guidelines/).

#Plot


*Hazbin Hotel* is the story of Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitating demons to peacefully reduce overpopulation in her kingdom. She opens a hotel in hopes that patients will be “checking out” into Heaven. While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie, and their first test subject, adult film-star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the “Radio Demon” reaches out to Charlie to assist in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality.

* #####  Tech Support posts are no longer permitted here. You may use r/WindowsHelp or r/TechSupport to get help with your PC.

* [Microsoft Discord Server](https://aka.ms/Community-discord#icon-chat)

* [Night Mode](https://nm.reddit.com/r/Windows10#icon-night) [Light Mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10#icon-day)

## Rules
* **1. Keep the discussion related to Windows 10**
Posts completely unrelated to Windows 10 will be removed. Just because something is compatible with Windows, doesn't mean this is the subreddit for it. Derailing conversations and threads is not allowed.

* **2. Flair posts correctly**
We are not extremely strict with what flair you pick, but if it's very wrong we will change it. If we select another flair, don't put the original one back. Not sure what flair to use? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2._flair_posts_correctly) to help you decide.

* **3. Do not distribute malicious programs**
Do not purposely distribute viruses or other harmful programs or apps. Advising the use of pirated software (including piracy, activation tools, and bypasses to enable paid features) is prohibited. This also includes "grey market" and other activation keys from unauthorized resellers.

* **4. Do not post Blogspam links or URL shorteners**
Blogspam, URL shorteners, mobile links, and referral and affiliate links are not allowed. Post the full desktop link for articles and news.

* **5. Be civil and do not troll others**
Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users are not allowed. Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information are also prohibited. Do not engage in blatant trolling or flaming.

* **6. Do not advertise a 3^rd party software without permission**
If you want to promote an app or website, you must [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Windows10) to request permission. Include as much relevant information as you can in both the modmail and the post. This is not a marketplace subreddit, selling anything is prohibited.

* **7. Do not promote pirated content or grey market keys**
Do not post pirated content or promote it in any way. Encouraging or hinting at the use of sellers of grey market keys is not allowed.

Windows LTSC (or LTSB) discussions are fine and welcome here; but it's hard to get it legally outside a corporate network.
Promoting Windows LTSC (or LTSB) to home users or escalating the discussion to piracy is not allowed.

* **8. Titles must be relevant to the post**
Irrelevant, sensationalized, or vague titles that have the pure intent of misleading or dramatizing a topic are not allowed. The relevancy of submissions' titles will be judged at the moderator's discretion.

* **9. Do not submit reposts, low-effort posts or rants**
Reposts are not allowed. All posts and answers that can easily be found by searching this subreddit or by using a search engine will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Although we encourage healthy discussions, rants and low-effort posts that do not contribute positively to the subreddit are not allowed.

* **10. Only post memes on Mondays. No tech support anytime**
Memes and other humor posts are only allowed on Mondays (UTC timezone) and they will be removed any other day of the week.
Not Monday yet? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10._only_post_memes.2C_concepts.2C_and_help_posts_on_mondays) to find more appropriate subreddits for your post.

* **2. Flair posts correctly**
We are not extremely strict with what flair you pick, but if it's very wrong we will change it. If we select another flair, don't put the original one back. Not sure what flair to use? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_2._flair_posts_correctly) to help you decide.

* **3. Do not distribute malicious programs**
Do not purposely distribute viruses or other harmful programs or apps. Advising the use of pirated software (including piracy, activation tools, and bypasses to enable paid features) is prohibited. This also includes "grey market" and other activation keys from unauthorized resellers.

* **4. Do not post Blogspam links or URL shorteners**
Blogspam, URL shorteners, mobile links, and referral and affiliate links are not allowed. Post the full desktop link for articles and news.

* **5. Be civil and do not troll others**
Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users are not allowed. Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information are also prohibited. Do not engage in blatant trolling or flaming.

* **6. Do not advertise a 3^rd party software without permission**
If you want to promote an app or website, you must [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Windows11) to request permission. Include as much relevant information as you can in both the modmail and the post. This is not a marketplace subreddit, selling anything is prohibited.

* **7. Do not promote pirated content or grey market keys**
Do not post pirated content or promote it in any way. Encouraging or hinting at the use of sellers of grey market keys is not allowed.

* **8. Titles must be relevant to the post**
Irrelevant, sensationalized, or vague titles that have the pure intent of misleading or dramatizing a topic are not allowed. The relevancy of submissions' titles will be judged at the moderator's discretion.

* **9. Do not submit reposts, low-effort posts or rants**
Reposts are not allowed. All posts and answers that can easily be found by searching this subreddit or by using a search engine will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Although we encourage healthy discussions, rants and low-effort posts that do not contribute positively to the subreddit are not allowed.

* **10. Only post memes on Mondays. No tech support anytime.**
Memes and other humor posts are only allowed on Mondays (UTC timezone) and they will be removed any other day of the week. Not Monday yet? Read [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10._only_post_memes.2C_concepts.2C_and_help_posts_on_mondays) to find more appropriate subreddits for your post.

2025-10-19 15:04:56,801 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.

###Community guidelines

* Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
* News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.
* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
* No referral links in submissions.
* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 0.2 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.
* Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from *new* merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider [Reddit's self-serve advertising system](https://ads.reddit.com).
* Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to.
* Be aware that X, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. are full of impersonation.
* Do not post about altcoins and do not post off-topic political spam.

#Discord

The following discord is not officially affiliated or managed by this sub, but it is related and the person running it has been nice about asking as well as persistent, so into this sidebar it goes: discord.gg/csmajors

u/flopsythesecond is the moderator for this discord, and should be contacted if you have any trouble with it.

#Wait, what goes here vs /r/cscareerquestions?

Good question! It's like this: if the question is more about college/university, it goes here; if it's more about a job, it goes there; if it's in between, it can go in either one.

Examples of questions that can go in either would be, "Are college career fairs worth it?" or "What do you actually use from CS classes in real jobs?" or "Someone gave me this advice about getting an internship, is this right?" For more details, check out the rules.

##**Guidelines**

**1.** **Submissions must directly relate to MHW**
&gt; Topics that are not related to Monster Hunter: World will be removed.

**2.** **Use the Search Bar**
&gt; Do not repost content that already exists on /r/MonsterHunterWorld. This also includes posting topics that have been discussed in the past. Please take the time to use the search bar if you have a question. It's likely it may have been asked before. Doing so drastically reduces clutter on the subreddit's feed. Submissions that violate this rule will be removed. Multiple violations will result in a temporary/permanent ban (depending on severity).

**3.** **Be Respectful. “Toxicity” Will NOT Be Tolerated!**   
&gt; 
While we have no problem with disagreements/discussions, the following behavior will NOT be tolerated: Insults, inciting pointless arguments, trolling, hate speech, sexist remarks, discrimination, witch hunts against other members, etc. Posts that contain identifying info, including guesses at other party’s online/real ID’s, will also be removed and reported to reddit admins. Uncivil/toxic behavior of any kind will be removed at moderator discretion. Repeated offenses WILL result in a ban.

**4.** **Memes On Weekends Only**  
&gt; The following content MAY ONLY BE POSTED ON WEEKENDS (Saturday (0000 hrs UTC)- Sunday (2359 hrs UTC): Memes, Carves &amp; Quest Results, Kill Screens, Decorations, Minor Achievements (trophies), Crafted Equipment collections, Investigations, pictures of TV/Monitor Screens...etc  Blatant attempts at “Karma Farming” will be removed. Low effort content will be removed at Moderator discretion.

**5.** **Monetized Content/Self-Promotion**
&gt; Asking for money,  donations, “social media follows”, or linking to "any online store/marketplace" are not allowed. Self-Promotion that is thoughtful and well received, may be posted, as long as it is not excessive. Live streams are not allowed without the express permission of the moderation team via modmail (Clips of YOUR content are OK). Self-promotion may be removed at the discretion of the moderators.

**6.**  **Relating to Game Mods and Cheating**
&gt; Mods are allowed to be discussed and links are allowed to be posted. However, topics related to cheating/breaking the game's code may be removed upon moderator discretion.

**7.** **Spoilers**
&gt; We do not allow unmarked Spoilers pertaining to story content in the title, body or comment section.

**8.** **LFG Posts**
&gt; All LFG posts should be posted on /r/MonsterHunterClan, our partner subreddit, unless there is an event megathread that explicitly states that LFG is allowed inside that thread. Any LFG posts will be removed.

**9.** **Art Submissions Must Adhere to Specific Criteria**
&gt; When you create an art submission, please post the following in the comments:

(a) Post is tagged as Art

(b) Artist’s name

(c) Link to source in thread

Also please abide by the following: Lewd art featuring some of the more scandalous armors like the female Odogaron, Kirin, and Nergigante are permitted when tagged NSFW. No posting of pornographic material. If you are unsure, contact us mods before posting. Posts failing to meet the above criteria will be removed at moderator discretion.

**10.** **Do Not Create Spam Posts/Comments**

&gt; Please do not create spam posts/comments. Content of this nature will be removed by the moderators. Violations of this rule will result in a temporary ban. Continued violations after a temporary ban will result in a permanent ban.

&gt; **Welcome to /r/Trees!**  
---
 ---
###**Please make sure to read the rules before posting.**
&gt; The go-to subreddit for anything and everything cannabis.

&gt;[•º **Join us on Discord!** º•](https://discord.gg/3WY4ttc)

#### [](#h4-green)  
&gt; **Posting Rules**
---
 ---
*Remember: the rules change on weekends! See 'The /r/trees Weekend' below.*
 ---
1. **No Black Market Sourcing:** Do not offer, or ask for, recommendations on: where or how, on the black market, to acquire cannabis or anything derived from it (extracts, edibles, seeds, THC, CBD, etc.) freely exchanged or otherwise; or on how to smuggle, transport, ship, mail, or otherwise travel with cannabis or its derivatives. Do not make any posts involving meetups or other location-specific topics.
2. **No personal attacks:** Be respectful to fellow posters – name-calling, rudeness, slurs, vulgarities towards other users, and trolling are not welcome here.
3. **No minors:** /r/trees is strictly 18+ only, no exceptions (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_.2Fr.2Ftrees_18.2B.3F) for more information on why). You might be interested in /r/saplings instead, where Redditors under 18 can ask questions about cannabis and its effects.
4. **No advertising:** All forms of advertising and self-promotion are strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, posts promoting specific products or name brands, promoting YouTube channels or other forms of Social Media, and linking to online stores or other places designed to make money. Learn more about self-promotion on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).   Learn more about [spam](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-spam-am-i-spammer) on Reddit.
5. **No low-quality link posts outside of Saturday:** This includes memes, image macros, screenshots, simple trees references (such as pineapples and “420”), posts  about broken glassware and spilled bowls, and all posts not directly about cannabis (besides the title). Those are allowed on “Slack-Post Saturday” every week, but you can make all those posts at /r/see during the week instead. See the [visual posting guide](http://imgur.com/a/1WL7J) showing types of disallowed posts.
6. **No NSFW/Porn:** Do not post nudity or any sort of explicit porn. 
7. **No reposts:** For links, this involves any picture posted in the previous 6 months. For text posts, this involves asking any commonly asked questions on /r/trees (including questions about drug testing). For those, use the search bar and our [FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/wiki/faq).
8. **No posts that harm the community:** Do not post pictures of tagging/vandalism, encourage driving while high (including pictures where you are obviously driving while high), post about sneaking weed past TSA, or make other posts harmful to the trees community.
9. **No posts promoting political candidates:** Posts that endorse a political candidate, regardless of the connection to cannabis, are disallowed.  
10. **No posts involving a personal loss:** Those should be kept to the "Monday Mourning" thread each week.

The /r/trees mod team reserves the right to remove any other posts at our discretion. You can [contact the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftrees) with any questions.

#### [](#h4-green)  
&gt; **The /r/Trees Weekend**
---
 ---
####SLACK-POST SATURDAY
 ---
* Every **Saturday**, *we relax our rules*. Artwork, GIFs, and image macros are all permitted for the day.
* Not everything goes though: you still **can't** upload NSFW, ask for hookups/meetups, show disrespect towards other users or advertise anything *at all*. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2hhh5t/introducing_slack_post_saturday_bringing_back/).
&gt; 
---
####SELF-POST SUNDAY
 ---
* Every **Sunday**, *you can submit text posts only.*
* This allows for a break from all of the link posts during the week, so the community can share their stories and talk with each other. Naturally, we are less strict regarding the removal of text posts.

2025-10-19 15:04:56,886 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - subscribers 12242667
2025-10-19 15:04:56,887 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ###Welcome to /r/oddlysatisfying!
Here you can post things that make you feel, well, oddly satisfied. This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).
####What does "Oddly Satisfying" mean?
We are forever searching for a "true definition". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* "oddly satisfying" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.

***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**

######Rules:
**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**
###1)  **Banned Topics:**
We have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:

* **Memes or image macros**

* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as "2048", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.

* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.

* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).

* **Compilation Albums/Videos**
  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**
  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).
  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.

* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.

* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. 

* **No watermarks:**  We do not allow any images or videos that contain a watermark of a product or a username. These include TikTok videos and Instagram videos.

###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** 
NSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed ("Say it, don't show it."). 

###3)  **Reposts:** 
**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.


###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** 
Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.

###5)  **Submission Titles:**

* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.

* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.

* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as "My...", "Mine...", "Our...", "We...", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.

###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** 
Please cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.

* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**
* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)

###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**

* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: 
  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.

###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**

* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.
* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.
* The definition of what truly is "Oddly Satisfying" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.

###9) **Crossposts**
* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma.

Read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/wiki/faqs/homenetworking/). Please use the search function to look for keywords related to what you want to ask before posting since most common issues have been answered.

If you can't find what you're looking for, please feel free to post a new question after reading the rules. Use a descriptive title and explain the problem, not the solution.

**Post Flair:**

**Rules**

1. No Ads. This is a support and discussion subreddit. Ads and self promotion are not welcome here. Please stay on topic.
2. Don't be a jerk. Not being a jerk is surprisingly easy. To help with that, reddit provides the [reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette).
3. No URL shorteners. URL shorteners tend to hide the real use of a link. For this reason, please use normal links, even if they're long.
4. No affiliate links. Using affiliate Links in your own place is your decision. Not in this place though. We're focused on helping and discussing.
5. Please stay on topic. Sometimes discussions can go a little overboard and that is ok. If you're unsure if this is r/politics, someone done messed up.
6. No gatekeeping. With profession shall come professionalism. Extend help without judging others for their ignorance. The same goes for downvoting of comments or posts for "stupid questions" or not being as knowledgeable as others.
7. No network restriction bypass advice. Posts asking for help or advice regarding bypassing restrictions put in place by a network administrator will be removed, regardless of what the restrictions are and why you are looking to bypass them. Discussions about working from another country, accessing regional content or bypassing geolocation restrictions are not permitted (i.e. location shifting).

 Depending upon the severity of the offense a warning or instant ban may be given.

####4. Mark spoilers
- Rule applies to all of the content which was added in the latest update for the first 7 days.
- Any posts which contain spoilers must use the “spoiler” flair.

####5. Limit self-promotion
- Sharing of your own content is allowed, but it must follow the [reddit self-promotion rules](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

####6. Failure to provide proper attribution
- All builds/art/memes/etc. should be your own. Please make every effort to find the original author of a work, such as by reverse image searching. Reposting is acceptable, but you must provide proper attribution to the original artist, for instance by linking to the original or mentioning the user in a comment. If you cannot properly source a creation, you must still indicate that it is not your own. 

- Moderator discretion will be used to determine if there are any legitimately high-effort exceptions to this rule (i.e. Detailed post about things that might be included in a future patch)

* Do not offer to trade for a copy of the game.
* Do not bait people into asking for a copy of the game (e.g. saying that you have an extra copy of the game).

- Polls on frequently asked subjects (which class, which boss is easiest/hardest, etc.) will be removed.

- For more information about submission guidelines, reference the [submission guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/wiki/submission-guidelines) and the [submission infographic](https://i.imgur.com/JHTXoA3.png).

####9. No memes outside of weekends
- Memes are allowed only during weekends. Check the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/wiki/rules#wiki_9._no_memes_outside_of_weekends) for the exact timing.

####10. No duplicate posts
- Please [search the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/terraria/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) before posting, to avoid regularly asked questions and topics.
- For submissions such as Tweets or blog posts duplicates will be removed, preserving the earliest.
- The decision on whether to keep a later post or to make a new one if it has a more appropriate or better title is at the discretion of the moderators.

####11. No piracy links or requests
- Discussion of piracy is allowed, however encouraging and giving information on how to pirate the game will not be tolerated.

####12. No game help question posts

* Questions that require an image (like Technical game issues/In-game housing) are an exception.

2025-10-19 15:04:57,006 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ## About

A subreddit for sharing those miniature epiphanies that make the mundane more amazing.

"Showerthought" is a loose term that applies to the types of thoughts you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming. At their best, showerthoughts are universally relatable and provide new perspectives on the mundane.

Please be respectful of others' submissions. Rudeness is unacceptable. 

**Please read [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules) and [the requirements for each type of post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/requirements) before submitting.**

## Rules  

- **1. All submissions must be original.**    
Everything offered in /r/Showerthoughts must be written by its poster. AI-generated content, copied-and-pasted content, and other such unoriginal content is strictly forbidden.

- **2. All posts must meet [the minimum requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/requirements) for their flair.**     
Incorrectly flaired posts will be removed. **Very few posts will be showerthoughts.**

- **3. Your entire thought must be in the title.**     
Posts in /r/Showerthoughts must stand on their own. Explanations, elaboration, examples, or clarifications should only be offered as comments.

- **4. Submissions must be offered in error-free English.**    
Since posts in /r/Showerthoughts are rarely longer than a sentence, they must meet a minimum standard of quality.

- **5. No misinformation.**     
Misinformation of any kind is forbidden. This includes posts that use blatantly false premises to attract attention.

- **6. No done-to-death or banned posts.**      
Posts may not be jokes, puns, wordplay, advice, soapboxing, or "shower commentary" (like "Ow, this water is too hot!"). Posts pertaining to politics, religion, Reddit, and social justice are also forbidden, as are posts about or pertaining to language.

- **7. No spam or spam-enabling activity of any kind.**    
Spam and spam-enabling activity is strictly prohibited, regardless of how or where on Reddit it takes place. **Users may only offer one post per seventy-two-hour period.**

- **8. Remain civil at all times.**      
Bigotry, hate-speech, harassment, and personal attacks will result in immediate and permanent bans. Submissions which are hostile, intentionally demeaning, or directly insulting will be removed.

**Subreddit rules:**

**1. English only, please**

For moderation purposes, please stick to the official language of this subreddit, both for posts and comments.

You may link to sites in different languages, if you add a clear explanation what the content is about.

**2. Code of Conduct** 

[Read it here](https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct/)  
Breaching the code is a ban-able offence. In particular, we won't tolerate discrimination or bullying of any kind.

**3. Use appropriate flairs for your posts**

If you don't, we maintain the right to delete the post in violation of this rule. Flair descriptions: https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/wiki/index/flairs/

**4. Help rules**

Repeated neglect can result in a ban.  
1. Consult the documentation first  
2. Search for your question before posting  
3. Concrete questions/issues only! Don't ask "How to make X" before doing research  
4. "Can Godot be used to make this game?" Yes.  
5. Don't post photos of your screen, screenshots are okay, direct code with formatting or a pastebin is best  
6. We recommend checking the official forum for solutions as well. Make sure to link between the platforms when you cross-post questions.

**5. Promotion rules**

You are required to use the promotion flair whenever you want to showcase your game. Do NOT use the "discussion" flair. You may use "fun &amp; memes" when applicable, but do so sparingly and tailor your post to match the category.

**6. Discussion rules**

This flair is for constructive conversations, not for venting your frustrations. Should you have feedback for the engine development team directly, please open an issue or proposal on GitHub instead. Email the Code of Conduct team at conduct@godotengine.org for any "people problems" you might have. For reddit-specific problems, please use the ModMail or report functions. Do NOT use this flair to showcase your game, see the rule above.

**7. Post memes with consideration**

They must have the "fun &amp; memes" flair, be related to Game Development, and the topic/content cannot breach the Code of Conduct. Do not spam memes.

**8. Stay on topic**

This is a subreddit about the Godot Engine. While related Game Development topics are not forbidden, please make sure to tailor them towards the Godot project. This means NO ART posts unless you are talking about the technical side of things - there are enough other outlets to post your pretty renders and concepts.

**9. Getting started**

Reference this https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html before asking for general advice/help. Posts asking "Where do I start?" will automatically be locked, due to this subreddit overflowing with them in the past

**10. Copyright &amp; AI-generated content**

For legal reasons, you may only post content that you are the rights-holder of. This means you are required to credit assets according to the licenses you acquired them under. Some licenses permit sharing content without listing your sources, others do not. In particular, this means that AI-generated content needs to verifiable stem from a model which was trained only on data submitted with the original creator's consent. If you cannot prove this to be the case upon request, we remove your post.

##Subreddit Rules
1. **Remember The Human At All Times** - At all times, please be polite and respectful to each other. Even if you feel attacked, do not respond in kind and instead report offending comments to the mod team. This extends to comments on fan created content (including cosplay) – constructive criticism is allowed, but remember there is a human on the other end of the screen. Permanent bans may be issued depending on the severity of a violation.

2. **Be Careful with spoilers** - We would ask that any spoilers please be spoiler tagged. If you are making a post to discuss spoilers, please flair appropriately. Spoilers don't expire- whilst we appreciate some of these games are as old as Galuf, others may not have experienced the games, so please try and keep that in mind. Any malicious spoiling will result in a temporary ban, and repeat offenders will become permanently sent to The Void.

3. **Fan Content And Other Links** - AI-generated content is prohibited. Fan content (including but not limited to cosplay, artwork, music, lets plays, videos, etc) may only be posted by the original creator. Please indicate in your post title that your submission is OC. If your profile includes pinned links to your fan-content related business/social media accounts, or you wish to share these links in your post, then you must meet our self-promo quota prior to submission (5 non-fan content posts or comments on our subreddit within the past month). 

4. **Post Quality** - Any low effort post (such as achievements without discussion prompts, frequently reposted topics such as Catcher Chocobo posts and others), which cannot generate meaningful discussion, will be removed. Common questions (such as “where to start”) may be redirected to our weekly questions thread which is refreshed every Thursday. Memes may only be posted on Monday. Sales posts are not allowed and will be removed without warning. Finally, we prohibit illegal and explicit (actual nudity, sex acts, gore or mutilation) content on our subreddit. Any artwork considered 18+ may be allowed at the mod team’s discretion, but must be marked NSFW.

2025-10-19 15:04:57,178 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **BEFORE YOU POST SOME DANK ASS MEMES, HERE ARE SOME RULES**

 
**1)Don't Be Toxic**

-Toxic behavior is not tolerated. This includes harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, any form of discrimination based on identity along with excusing or defending racism, homophobia, paedophilia or ableism. Any posts or comments containing hate speech or slurs may result in an immediate ban with no warnings.

**2)F1 Memes Only**

-All posts must be F1-related memes. Posts that are giveaways, polls, random discussions, or bingo card/grid posts are forbidden (unless funny/well edited). The meme doesn't necessarily have to be in the content if it's funny or creative.

In the event of major F1 news, one discussion post may be allowed at the mods' discretion.

Meme templates are fine as long as they’re tagged with the appropriate flair.

**3)Low Quality Content**

-Unedited screenshots/videos/photos, borderline NSFW content or pre-existing memes with no changes do not meet the quality standard.

This also includes AI-generated content, TV screen photos, rehashing tired meme templates without originality or just posting your opinion over a generic template (this includes 'Change My Mind' type posts).

Be mindful that the enforcement of this rule may differ based on the period. In low traffic periods much more gray-area content may stay unremoved.

**4)No Brigading**

-Targeted criticism, ban celebration, brigading posts, comments or chat messages that criticise, mock, or promote hate toward other subreddits, moderators, users, or fan bases are not tolerated. Any content of this kind will be removed and may result in a ban without prior warning.

 **5)Don't Harass/Bait Other Users**

-Be civil and respectful. Healthy discussions and disagreements are welcome, but keep it respectful. Do not provoke, escalate, or engage in harassment of other users. Know where to draw the line—debate is fine, but personal attacks or hostility aren’t. In short, don’t be an asshole.

**6)No Doxxing/Targeting**

-We strictly prohibit any form of doxxing (sharing personal or private information) or targeted harassment of individuals or groups. This includes sharing or threatening to share private information such as real names, addresses, social media accounts, or any other identifying details without consent.

Posts or comments that encourage or facilitate targeted harassment, brigading, or harm toward others will result in an immediate removal and a ban for the poster.

**7)Don't Take Things Too Seriously**

-Remember, this is a meme subreddit – we’re here for laughs! F1 can be intense, but the memes are all in good fun. If a post or joke isn’t to your taste, scroll on and keep it cool. Friendly banter is encouraged, but leave the serious debates at the door. Relax, enjoy the humor, and let’s keep it lighthearted.

**8)No Reposts From The Subreddit**

-Reposts from the subreddit are not allowed if they have already been posted in the past couple weeks.

Reposts from other social media are always allowed, as long as the post does not have a watermark from an account that does not create their own content.

**9)Meme Template Posts**

-To curb the trend of generic F1 related or adjacent images being posted with the flair 'Meme Template', it is now a requirement for the OP to curate a meme with their chosen template in their Meme Template submission post, or the post will be removed.

**10)No Politics**

-Don't discuss political topics unrelated to F1.

**11)No Jokes About Death**

-Jokes about suicide and/or wishing death on others are strictly prohibited. We ask everyone to use common sense and be mindful of sensitive topics.

**12)No Self Promotion**
-If your posts consist solely of links to your own YouTube channel or social media without genuine participation in the subreddit, please refrain from spamming. However, if you create funny memes and watermark a post/link something related on your account in the comments it's not a problem.

**13)All Content Must Be In English**

-Small and commonly understood phrases or expressions are allowed, but please do not start conversations in other languages. Please also make sure your memes are understandable to english speakers.

**14)No Linking To Other Platforms**

(Only applies to posts)

-The only 2 exceptions are for image/video hosting sites that will show the content in full on reddit, and for established content creators.

**15)Mods' Discretion**

-Moderators have the final say in interpreting and enforcing subreddit rules. While we aim to be fair, mods reserve the right to remove posts or comments that, in their judgment, are in poor taste or harmful to the community, even if they don’t explicitly break a rule. This ensures that the subreddit remains a fun, respectful, and enjoyable space for everyone. If you have any concerns, feel free to reach out to the Mod Team for clarification.

### Rules

Please familiarize yourself with the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules/) of our community before you post.

**Rule #1**: Keep it friendly, be respectful and follow Reddiquette.

&gt; Keep it friendly, civil, respectful, and don’t be insulting on purpose. We’re here to celebrate gacha games, ask honest questions, and have constructive discussions.
&gt; 
&gt; Any post or comment that is too hostile, toxic, insulting, or breaks [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) may be removed, whether it’s directed at an individual or at a group of people.

**Rule #2**: New posts must be related to gacha gaming.

&gt; Our community’s topic is gacha gaming, but this will often include things that are indirectly related, such as relevant celebrity, tech, or financial news.
&gt; 
&gt; The relation to gacha gaming must be immediately obvious. Threads that are both not directly related to gacha gaming and deemed likely to stray too far off topic may be removed at the Moderation Team's discretion.

**Rule #3**: Don't post banned content.

&gt; Some content is disallowed within the subreddit, including:
&gt; 
&gt; * “Gacha Life” game content
&gt; * Threads/screenshots about mobile game ads
&gt; * Referral/Invite codes (allowed in release threads only)
&gt; * BST or give away of accounts/products
&gt; * Information breaking typical game TOS (ex. game exploits)
&gt; * Verifiable/intentional misinformation
&gt; * Game revenue/store ranking screenshots
&gt; 
&gt; Full List: [Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_3.3A_don.27t_post_banned_content.)

**Rule #4**: Post in the right place.

&gt; Many game-specific topics are OK. However, non-notable news unfit for a general gacha community should instead be discussed in the megathread or posted to the game-specific subreddit.
&gt; 
&gt; * Some commonly-shared content that is disallowed includes:
&gt; * Character trailers and new banner news (unless part of a collaboration)
&gt; * Regular patch notes and content updates (version trailers are allowed)
&gt; * Most common social posts and in-game announcements

**Rule #5**: No low-effort posts.

&gt; Every submission must be able to hold water as a standalone post. This means that you are required to submit enough substance for others to discuss without relying on additional comments.
&gt; 
&gt; **Titles for single-game-related submissions must include the game's name for immediate clarity.**
&gt; 
&gt; If you're simply asking a question, that’s fine, but please use the pinned Megathread to do so. Common discussion topics are only allowed once every 30 days.
&gt; 
&gt; Memes are allowed only on Saturday's.

**Rule #6**: Label your post properly.

&gt; Please use the most relevant post flair from those available.
&gt; 
&gt; When promoting unofficial content like streams, Discords, subreddits, YT videos, surveys, etc., **include [PROMO] at the beginning of your title.**

&gt; **[PROMO] posts are limited to once / 7 days per member/creator/channel to prevent spam.**
&gt; 
&gt; Links to official websites, streams, and channels do not require the [PROMO] tag, but do need an appropriate flair.
&gt; 
&gt; Non-nudity NSFW content is allowed, but it must be appropriately tagged.

**Rule #7**: Try, try again.

&gt; While posts are most often removed because they were shared in the wrong place, sometimes the content just needs to be amended or added to with an edit.
&gt; 
&gt; Titles must be descriptive and include the individual game's name, if applicable.
&gt; 
&gt; When sharing game news or information, please include a link to the source or content if not already included as part of the post type. Screenshots of articles are not allowed; these must be submitted as link posts or have their link provided in the post body.

2025-10-19 15:05:13,460 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **SUBREDDIT RULES**

1. **No troll questions or answers.** Questions that are here to bait people to answer or to create drama (i.e. What's 1 + 1, who is the President, why are you guys so stupid, etc.). These belong in /r/ShittyAdvice.

2. **No open-ended or "what-if" questions.** These questions have multiple if not an infinite amount of answers and ask users to share their opinions, thoughts, beliefs, and/or personal experiences. These belong in /r/AskReddit, /r/WhatIf, or /r/FutureWhatIf, or r/whowouldwin no matter how stupid and/or embarrassing they are. You should ask questions with straight answers. However, you are allowed to ask poll/survey type questions only if they have pre-determined options as answers.

3. **Don't be a dick.** A petty insult or taunt is fine, but do not go overboard.

4. **No bigotry, racism, or race-baiting** We have a zero tolerance policy on race baiting, racism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, queerphobia. Any comments/posts that demonstrates these kinds of attitudes will be immediately deleted and the user will be banned.

5. **No question about politics/religion/LGBT+** We cannot manage the sudden influx of people and questions that sparks a lot of hate and misinformations like those, we are working on a fix to be able to moderate those questions in an easier manner. Post political questions on r/PoliticalDebate, religion questions on r/religion, and LGBT questions on r/askLGBT.

6. **Unintelligible** Please write coherent questions when posting. 

7. **Moderator discretion** Posts and comments may be removed if they are nasty/obscene, juvenile, underage inappropriate, or do not match the community description. This includes "painless suicide methods" and other topics best discussed elsewhere.

8. **Reddit age/karma**
If you are very new to Reddit and/or your Reddit karma score is too low, your posts or comments will be removed by our Automoderator. For more information, read this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidquestions/comments/1c4dztz/please_read_the_rules_before_posting_or_commenting/

And we've seen every bad photoshopped ad with a guy hitting a putter into a chipping net or DJ hitting driver pasted on a putting mat in a driveway. No need to share those, they will be deleted.

### Rules:

Please read the [full rules wiki here](https://reddit.com/r/seattle/wiki/rules).

### 1. Be Good - No hate, bigotry, or harassment

We do not allow personal attacks or abusive / hateful language towards users.

No slurs, abusive, toxic, or discriminatory content, including hate speech, racism, sexism, transphobic, homophobic, ableist, or xenophobic content. This also covers doxxing, trolling, harassing or intimidating users, brigading subreddits, witch-hunts, non-consensual images/videos, and suggestions of violence. This is not an exhaustive list.

Flagrant violations will result in immediate and sometimes permanent bans.

### 2. Keep posts Seattle-related

Posts must be relevant to the city of Seattle or the greater metro area.

International or national news without a specific or relevant local slant does not suffice.

### 3. Limit reposts and repetitive topics

Reposts of articles will be removed. Posts of different articles covering the same topic may also be removed if the new articles do not contain significant deviation in reporting or new information.

Posts about topics that have been previously resolved or discussed ad nauseum will be
removed at moderator discretion. Please search before posting.

### 4. No low-effort content

Please search before posting. Posts without sufficient effort or relevance will be removed, such as:

- Screenshots instead of links to articles/websites
- Lazy requests without specific details
- Common FAQs or questions that can be answered with a quick google or reddit search (try [r/AskSeattle](https://reddit.com/r/askseattle))
- Generative AI content without substantial commentary or human influence
- Unrelated rants and off-topic discussion that don't contribute to meaningful conversation

### 5. Use AskSeattle for recommendations

This includes questions or recommendations on neighborhoods, where to eat / stay / visit, moving tips, hidden gems, etc.

Instead, please direct these questions to r/AskSeattle, post in our [weekly pinned AskSeattle thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/?f=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Thread%22), or check out the [/r/Seattle discord](https://reddit.com/r/seattle).


### 6. No advertisements, self-promotion, sales, or classifieds

Do not post anything that you stand to profit from. This includes self-affiliated businesses, services, events, promos, giveaways, referral codes, or ticket links. Local businesses and creators should post in our weekly promo thread.

Do not post anything promoting a potential transaction, such as items for sale/wanted, job listings, or asking for openings. Use r/sealist or r/seajobs. Giveaways of free items are allowed, please use "FREE" in the title.

### 7. Do not editorialize

Post titles of articles should properly match the article headline if possible. All post titles should be factual and free from clickbait phrases, editorialization, and misleading information.

Do not add personal commentary in the body of the post, add it as a comment on the post.

### 8. No crowdfunding, surveys, or data gathering

Do not share links to crowdfunding sites or any other requests for donations or financial assistance. Any posts or comments in violation will be removed.

Do not post surveys or forms for the purpose of market research or data collection. Posts including links or codes to sign up for events may be allowed at moderator discretion.
Verifiable employees from local universities administrating clinical trials or studies should contact the moderation team with details for post approval.

### 9. Follow standards for posts about crime

Posts claiming witness to, or accusations of crime must provide evidence within the post of said crime occurring. This can be a photo/video of the crime happening, a news article covering the crime, or other substantial evidence that fully proves said crime taking place.

Posts must contain proof, if you need to verify content privately you must contact the moderators before posting.

Posts must not contain requests for identifying, locating, or engaging with suspected individuals.

### 10. Follow standards for missing people, pets, or items posts

Do not post lost or missing flyers unless they were made by you.

Missing people, pets, or stolen property posts must contain pictures and last known location.

Missing person or vehicle posts must include a police case number and **may not contain personal contact information**. Users should **only** be directed to contact police, tiplines, or news agencies, otherwise posts will be removed without exception.

# **WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY REGARDING TROLLING AND BRIGADING.**

Users engaging in these activities will be instantly and permanently banned.

#About

"I guess Devil Hunter's the best for making money," proclaims chronically broke Denji, a Devil Hunter-for-hire. With his trusty chainsaw and chainsaw...dog, Denji vies to make it to his next meal; however, nothing is ever as it seems, and things never go as planned.

Madness begins with the story of a dark hero who will rock the world. A new era of devils, hunters, and chainsaws begins!

### [](#h3-blue)
&gt; # Crown Laws of /r/crusaderkings
&gt; **1.** The actual content of a post - not just the title, or the general idea - needs to be related to Crusader Kings. A picture of a crusader doing something silly? Not related, and it will be removed. If you just want history related memes, go to /r/trippinthroughtime or /r/ParadoxExtra . This rule is being enforced at the time of posting, rather than us having to go through the sub and remove a bunch of old posts.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **2.** Don't be racist, discriminatory, or otherwise a dick.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **5.** If you post a screenshot of the game, please point out what you want people to look at in the image or explain in the comments.

While reposts in /r/Jokes are allowed, they must meet [all criteria for acceptance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index#wiki_rule_2.3A_no_reposts_of_recent_jokes.).

3. **No bigotry, sexualization of minors, hate-speech, misogyny, or other unwelcome content.**      
Per [Reddit's site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), unwelcome content is not allowed in posts or comments. [Read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index#wiki_rule_3.3A_no_unwelcome_content.).

4. **No spam or spam-enabling activity of any kind.**      
Spam and spam-enabling activity is strictly prohibited, regardless of how or where it takes place. [Read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index#wiki_rule_4.3A_no_spam_or_spam-enabling_activity_of_any_kind.). Users may only submit three jokes in a twenty-four-hour period.

Remember to treat your fellow Redditors with politeness and respect. Repeated or egregious violations will result in bans.

7. **Accounts must be in good standing.**

#Rules

1. All posts must be directly related to Starfield. 

2. Do not post spoilers in titles, period. Use spoiler tags when commenting sensitive information.

3. Only relevant images are permitted in posts. Do not post memes, image macros, or low-effort content as posts. Do not post AI "Art"

4. Follow proper [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette) when submitting and commenting. Keep it civil, do not make personal attacks to other users, even if they initiated it. Absolutely no harassment, witch-hunting, sexism, racism or hate speech will be tolerated.

5. Do not spam. Always follow [Reddit guidelines for self-promotion](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043504051-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-) when sharing your own content. More than 1/10 of your posts or comments being self-promotional is spamming. Livestream promotion is not allowed. Discord promotion is not allowed.

6. Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average person has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis (this "...").

7. Do not post rumors or leaks without evidence. Do not post NDA breaching leaks. Any posts that claim validity without proof will be deleted. Word of mouth and second hand accounts are not evidence. You may [submit your evidence](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FStarfield&amp;subject=&amp;message=) to the independent Moderators in confidence, for verification first. If a leak comes from someone breaking legal agreements or the law, do not post it here.

8. No promotion or enabling of pirated content. This includes but is not limited to: torrents, free full-game downloads, .exe files, pirated mods, pirated keys, third party market resellers, etc.


####Spoiler Tags

- To create a spoiler tag, use the following markup:

 &gt; Welcome to the \&gt;!Starfield!&lt; subreddit.

- This will show up as:

 &gt; Welcome to the &gt;!Starfield!&lt; subreddit.

___

All posts and comments in the end, come down to moderator discretion.

For any further clarification or questions please do not hesitate to get in touch.

# Rules

|||
:-:|:-:
**No Spoilers in Post Titles or without Spoiler Tags**|Absolutely no spoilers in post titles. Use spoiler post tags and proper spoiler markdowns for content that has been widely released within the past month. Spoilers do not include trailers, comics, casting announcements, or most other official marketing material. 
**Be Civil**|Respect the opinions of others and treat them with dignity without regard to their gender, race, political beliefs, religion, appearance, or sexual orientation. Insulting, harassing, threatening, or acting rudely towards other users will not be tolerated and can result in the removal of your comment and a temporary or permanent ban. Film, television, and media is subjective and differing opinions are to be expected.
**No Low Effort Posts**|Low-effort posts include but are not limited to: memes, flame bait, fake/misleading news, rumors (exception: links to coverage of rumors by major comic or film news sites), fan casts with minimal effort; birthday posts, merchandise, what if; who would win, rankings, inappropriate content, etc. 
**No Spam**|Spam is strictly prohibited and includes not just commercial spam but (1) reposts; (2) flooding a sub with posts or a post with comments; (3) self-promotion without actively contributing on the sub outside of your own content; (4) serial agenda/hate posting.
**Stay on Topic**|All content must be focused on comic-book films and tv shows and the industry around those. Posts that are too much about actual comics, video games, toys, politics, etc. will be removed. 
**No Illegal Content or Piracy**|Piracy is strictly prohibited and will result in an instant ban.

# What is \/r/PlayStation?

Your community-run home for all things PlayStation on Reddit! Console/game discussions, news, trophy/media sharing and more!

---
# Rules:

####1. Be Respectful to Others
&gt;Keep it civil and do not personally attack other users. Treat others with respect. There is no place for harassment, abuse, hate speech, insults, threats, or trolling.

####2. Stay On-Topic
&gt;Conversation must relate to PlayStation culture, hardware, games, or services in some way. Discussion of other brands or products is allowed only if there is a comparison or connection back to PlayStation.

&gt;Additionally, steering conversations to become overly-political or no longer in the spirit of gaming is not allowed. 

#### 3. No Spoilers
&gt; Do not post unmarked spoilers or put any spoilers in a post title. Spoiler formatting is simple to use and works on most mobile devices as well.

#### 4. No Piracy
&gt;Do not create posts or comments seeking to actively engage in piracy, hacking, jailbreaking, gamesharing, account sharing, or distribution of game images with other community members.

#### 5. No Solicitation
&gt; Solicitation of transactions of any digital or physical products, goods, services, or accounts is not allowed. This includes buying, selling, trading, contests and giveaways, and begging.

&gt; Sharing your PlayStation-themed original content (images, art, videos, etc.) is allowed, but posts strictly asking for account following or purchases of your content is not allowed.

#### 6. 50% MEDIA SELF-PROMOTION LIMIT
&gt; Sharing your own branded / channel-based multimedia content is allowed only if you have a post submission history where no more than 50% of your last 10 posts (across all subreddits) are also similar self-promotion. A submission history of at least 10 posts is also required.

#### 7. No Impersonating Sony / SIE
&gt; Do not post claiming to be an employee of Sony or Sony Interactive Entertainment. If you wish to engage with this subreddit in an official manner on behalf of your company, please contact the Mod Team via Modmail.

#### 8. No low-effort content or comments 
&gt; Submissions must have enough substance to initiate a discussion or provide value to the community. Self-posts with only a title and very little or no text are not allowed. Comments must add meaningful value to a discussion (e.g. comments such as "I really want a new PSP", "I wish this was on PS4", or reaction GIFS will be removed). Before submitting or adding a comment ask yourself: "Does this add significant information or merit to the discussion?"

#### 9. Weekly Discussion Thread
&gt; Any topics already covered in this Weekly Discussion Thread will be removed if posted separately at the moderators' discreation. This helps keep the subreddit organized and ensures everyone can participate in a central discussion. Please check here first before creating new posts about ongoing topics.

#### 10. Weekly Support/Purchase Thread
&gt; All Tech Support and Purchase Recommendation questions should be posted in the dedicated Tech Support &amp; Purchase Recommendations Megathread. Posts on these topics made separately will be removed at the moderators' discreation.

#### 11. Always link to the original source whenever possible

&gt; If the original source is unavailable, you may link to an appropriate alternative. Avoid blogspam—websites that copy or embed content without adding value. However, alternatives with meaningful analysis may be allowed, but the original source should be prioritized. If a source redirects to another, link to the one with the most context. For example, if a tweet links to a developer's blog post, link directly to the blog post.

#### 12. Submission Title Guidelines

&gt; Use the original title when possible. If unclear or too complex, modify it for clarity without sensationalism or editorializing. You may add relevant context like the author's name, spoilers, NSFW warnings, release dates, or platforms. Titles must be in English, civil, and concise. Avoid all-caps (unless in the original), inflammatory language, or phrases like "This deserves attention." If more context is needed, consider a self-post.

&gt; In addition, self posts must have a proper title in place to describe the gist of your post in short. No clickbait or irrelevant titles will be allowed and such posts shall be removed at moderators' discretion.

#### 13. No surveys or polls are allowed 
&gt; Posts asking users to fill out surveys, forms, or participate in polls will be removed.

####Spoiler Guide

&gt; For **simple spoilers**, use the following formatting:
&gt; 
&gt;     **Spoiler** &gt;!The La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo!?!&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; It will look like this:
&gt; 
&gt; **Spoiler** &gt;!The La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo!?!&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; To use **labeled spoilers**, you can put a prefix before the word spoiler to add context like the following example:
&gt; 
&gt;     **God of War Spoiler** &gt;!BOY!!&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; It will look like this:
&gt; 
&gt; **God of War Spoiler** &gt;!BOY!!&lt;

# Welcome to \/r/skiing!

##We are a community for skiers of all skill levels and styles.

###New here? 

#Rules

#####1. Don't be rude or a bully.
#####2. All submissions must be related to skiing.
#####3. No blatant self promotion posts.
#####4. No posts already covered in megathreads.
#####5. Helmet discussions should stay in the megathreads.
#####6. No linking or reccomending backcountry.com or its affiliates.
#####7. No buying or selling gear. r/geartrade has you covered there. 


###New to skiing in general?
####Read our [beginner's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/2ez2pg/faqs_about_gear_and_some_tips_for_beginners/) by professional boot-fitter and ski tech /u/Maladjusted_vagabond

**Ski Boot questions?** See a [bootfitter](http://www.bootfitters.com/find-a-fitter). Seriously, see a bootfitter.  Do not post here asking if a boot is good for you.  A good boot is one that fits.  Even the seemingly all-knowing /u/Maladjusted_vagabond cannot help you find a good boot without looking at your feet and having you try some on.  


**DIN and technical questions?**  Please, ask them on /r/skiing.  However, remember that you are taking advice from people on the internet.  /r/skiing mods do take the time to require proof for all user flairs that involve any expertise and skill; however, with questions that could lead to an injury, getting shop advice is always the wisest choice.

##Rules:

1.  **Mods = Gods**  
Do NOT break any rules that the mods might invent on the spot.  

2. **4chan Only**  
Do NOT post anything unrelated to 4chan. Do NOT link directly to 4chan.org. Do NOT post anything from unrelated websites. Screencaps from 4chan are ideal.  

3. **New Content Only**  
Do NOT post screencaps over a year old, do NOT repost, and do NOT omit the date and time stamp. Those posts belong in /r/classic4chan (RIP).

4. **High Quality Only**  
This applies to quality content and quality presentation. Crop your post so it's actually legible. Don't post garbage that isn't entertaining.  

5. **No Redditry**  
Do NOT act like a basic reddit bitch. This includes cliche reddit phrases, subreddit mentions, puns, song lyrics, novelty accounts, getting lots of karma on a single post, sperging out at someone like a 13 year old on Xbox, and other dummy things that make you a manchild.  
E.g. not my proudest fap, /r/theydidthemath, I did nazi that coming, cake day, Fake and Gay, /u/[somethingstupid], 1000 upvotes, etc.  

6. **No Doxxing**  
Do NOT reveal personal information, or post 4chan screenshots that contain personal information of any individual. Do not post 4chan screenshots of Reddit account names or calls for raids. Remember, NYPA.  

7. **No CP**  
Do not post nude images of underage children, or say that nude images of underage children aren't child pornography, or say that nude images of underage children are okay, or describe images of underage children in text form.  
If we see you do this anywhere on Reddit, we will report you to the law enforcement agency of where you live.

8. **NSFW marking**  
Do NOT forget to mark NSFW content. The overall subreddit is SFW, so people need to really know when a submission is legit NSFW. (Potty Words are not NSFW).  

9. **No Grooming**  
No agendaposting.

10. **Admin abuse**  
The admins bypassed the mods and directly took action on the subreddit.

## Mods Statement:

----

We personally severely dislike reddit and everyone who frequents it. We believe it's a shitty, destructive echo chamber that does public harm as an internet publisher. We think this website discourages real interpersonal communication, and encourages addict-like consumption.

2025-10-19 15:05:13,581 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ##Submission/commenting Rules:
 
1) **10 comment karma in /r/Entrepreneur to post**  
To lead a discussion in /r/Entrepreneur, we require a minimum of 10 comment karma within our subreddit. This is earned by contributing thoughtful comments to others' discussions. This policy not only helps reduce spam but ensures that you understand the community's dynamics—what types of posts resonate, and what might be overlooked or poorly received.

Our goal is to help your posts gain traction. Take some time to engage with the community and discover how we can best support you.

2) **No Promotion**  
Posts and comments must NOT be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, your company or any service.

Dropping URLs, asking users to DM you, check your profile, or comment for private resources will all lead to a permanent ban.

It is acceptable to cite your sources, however, there should not be an explicit solicitation, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness.

3) **No Personal Attacks**  
Constructive criticism of ideas, concepts, approaches, or plans is encouraged. Embracing reality, even when it is challenging, is a crucial aspect of business. However, personal attacks, hostility, or incitement to conflict are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated in this community.

If you encounter threats or harassment, please report them immediately. Avoid engaging with users who are harassing you or others.

4) **Links Allowed as Supporting Material ONLY**  
This rule exists to foster meaningful discussion. If you wish to share links, they must be directly relevant, clearly described, and essential to the conversation. Your post should include sufficient context within Reddit to enable a productive dialogue.

5) **No “How To Get Rich Quick” posts**  
This community is NOT for quick money schemes. Entrepreneurship is often a challenging and demanding journey, requiring effort, hard work, grit, and determination. Posts asking how to make $X, without a specific or reasonable idea, will not be tolerated, as they do not contribute meaningfully to the discussions in this subreddit.

6) **Avoid unprofessional communication**  
As a professional subreddit, we expect all members to uphold a standard of reasonable decorum. Treat fellow entrepreneurs with the same respect you would show a colleague. While we don't have an HR department, that’s no excuse for aggressive, foul, or unprofessional behavior. NSFW topics are permitted, but they must be clearly labeled. When in doubt, label it.

AI-generated content is not acceptable to be posted. If your posts or comments were generated with AI, you may face a permanent ban.  

7) **No free offerings threads**  
Our "Thank You Thursday" threads are designated for any promotions, offers, or discounts you wish to share with the community. Please refrain from posting free offerings outside of this weekly thread that is pinned to the top of the community. Any such posts made elsewhere will be removed.

8) **Follow the [Rules of Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)**  
They apply everywhere on Reddit. Also consider [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/) The latter isn't mandatory but might be used in considering the intent of your post.

9) **Unsolicited Opinions and Duplicate Thoughts**  
Posts in Entrepreneur should be unique. If a duplicate post can be found on one or more similar subreddits or on a blog, then it's not a good fit for this subreddit.

Please refrain from using this community as your personal blog. There is no need to share opinions or use this space as a diary for daydreams, thoughts, or subjective reflections.

10) **No Investment Solicitation**  
Posts about specific investments, such as cryptocurrency, are not permitted. Please refrain from soliciting, promoting, or offering any form of investment advice. There are other subreddits better suited for those discussions.

##u/r2d8 

You'll see people using **bold** to highlight games, that gives the opportunity to interact with /u/r2d8, a bot that can be used to grab data from BGG on games included in a post. The simplest use is to bold game names in your comment and add "/u/r2d8 getinfo" at the end of the post, but [this post/sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/r2d8/comments/35vjro/faq_bugs/) has other features identified.

# **guide to a good hmmm**

**hmmms** are textless images that make you think about the context, do a double take, invoke a deeper meaning, or just leave you thinking about how or why they exist:

- [bizarre **hmmm**](http://i.imgur.com/WORLtGl.jpg)
- [humour **hmmm**](http://i.imgur.com/P5PLlvA.jpg)
- [arresting **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/vjTWeOw.jpg)
- [beautiful **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/eGXfj03.png)
- [confusing **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/yOysToi.jpg)
- [mystery **hmmm**](https://i.imgur.com/s81FiO1.jpg)

As long as they give you a good solid [**hmmm...**](http://i.imgur.com/Zv8OoCi.jpg) why would that bear be in a cubicle...

**hmmms** should be aesthetic and meaningful, avoid anything that is merely r/mildlyinteresting.

2025-10-19 15:05:13,605 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ____________

###Post Format

____________

&amp;nbsp;

* All posts must have "Maybe Maybe Maybe" as their title.

* All posts must be in a video or a gif (.ogg, .gifv, .gif, .webm or .mp4) format.

&amp;nbsp;

____________

###Rules

____________

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Posts must be relevant to the subreddit**

The principle of this subreddit is for posts to make the user question what the outcome or result will be. Your submission should convey a feeling of uncertainty.

We will remove posts that:

* show significant violence, serious bodily harm or death (to human or animal).
* contain political content.
* are obviously staged.
* have no discernible outcome.
* contain text which explains the outcome of a video beforehand.

We understand that "MaybeMaybeMaybe" can be pretty subjective. Some posts will have more uncertainty, some less - and we'll keep this in mind when reviewing submissions.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Recent reposts within 2 months are not allowed**

In order to make sure content stays interesting and enjoyable, we don't allow the same video or GIF to be posted within 2 months of the last time it was posted. 

Common reposts may be removed independently of this limitation.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Keep posts/comments civil**

Please keep all posts and comments respectful and engage in civil discussion with other users. 

If you believe a user is being unnecessarily toxic or hostile, please refrain from retaliating or using insults and instead report it to avoid unintentionally breaking this rule yourself. 

Some of the things that are prohibited under this rule are but are not limited to:

* targeted harassment or discrimination against users for their gender, sexuality, race, nationality or religion.
* directing insults and other offensive remarks toward other users.
* threatening, inciting, or encouraging physical harm or violence.
* unwanted sexual comments.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Submission Statement Required**

Our subreddit bot, u/mmm-submission-bot, will request posters to reply within 15 minutes with a statement at least 50 characters in length explaining why the post is appropriate for this subreddit. Failure to reply to the bot will result in the removal of the post.

&amp;nbsp;

____________

&amp;nbsp;

This sub disguises the origin of the posts by replacing all titles with "Maybe Maybe Maybe".  If you prefer the "original flavor" (i.e. leaves the post titles alone) check out /r/maybemaybeoriginal.

**Rules**

Posts must be circlejerks (makes fun of reddit hivemind opinion), meta posts (link to circlejerky reddit content), or unjerks to have discussion about NBA or /r/nba related content. Memes or image posts are allowed but still must be "circlejerks".

Meta posts (screenshots or links to /r/nba content) must have a visible upvote count, and must be heavily upvoted or downvoted. If someone has a dumb take and gets blasted with downvotes, it's not appropriate for this subreddit.

Offensive/edgy posts just for the sake of being offensive/edgy are not allowed. This isn't circlejerking.

Don't use slurs even ironically. This includes the n-word.

Congratulations to /u/NagyGOATSlayer69 for getting a B- in Calculus! Keep it up, champ!

2025-10-19 15:05:13,608 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ## Rules

1. **The submission should not be interesting**. This rule is just for submissions, not for comments.

2. **No Racism and Hate speech**. Racism and hate speech will be removed and the poster will be banned. No questions asked.

3. **Moderator Discretion**. Posts are at the discretion of the moderators. If we do not believe it fits the sub, or think it is spam, we will remove it. Posts that have been recently posted or is in top of all time may be removed.

4. **No blank images**. Posts that are just a solid color or REALLY low effort will be removed. An example of what counts as "really low effort" is only posting a picture of a bodypart.

5. **"I have an (un)interesting thing but I won't show you" posts are banned**. All "I have an interesting thing but I won't show you" format memes are now banned. This subreddit is not meant for low effort format posting, that instead of being not interesting, actually become annoying.

6. **"Comment x" posts are banned** No posts requiring or hinting towards users leaving comments or playing games. An example of a title that would be removed for violating this rule is "Help me count, I will start". However, having a question in your title is allowed, but the question should not make the post interesting.

7. **No contextless selfies**. No posts that are just a selfie with a random title. If you are doing something in the picture that's one thing, but just a selfie of you smiling at the camera and the title is "I had pizza for lunch" or anything like that, it will be removed.

8. **No "Reddit Meta" Posts**. Don't post screenshots of your reddit profile, how much upvotes someone got or how much karma or reddit notifications you got. Also don't post any of your reddit awards, streaks or ban messages from a subreddit. 



- A place to post the most uninteresting and boring content on the web!

&amp;nbsp;

[](https://discord.gg/theindiestone)

&amp;nbsp;

Project Zomboid is an isometric zombie survival game created by The Indie Stone, currently available on the [Humble Store](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/projectzomboid_storefront), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/forum/project_zomboid#1457962849) and on [Steam's Early Access](http://store.steampowered.com/app/108600).

###Rules

[Full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/about/rules/)

* 1: **Server Advertisements**: Server advertisements or posts otherwise extenuating the features of a server or event should be posted no more than twice per 30 days.

* 2: **Be Lovely**: Be lovely, follow the [reddiquette guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Criticism and discussion thereof are welcome but abusive comments are not. Do not engage in personal attacks, even in retribution. Instead of lashing back, report them and move on.

* 3: **Inappropriate Images**: Any graphic images posted that are deemed inappropriate (hardcore pornography, scat, dead bodies etc are prime examples) will be deleted and the posters treated like spam bots. This is your only warning.

* 4: **Touchy Subjects, Appeals**: In cases where the mods have a problem with your conduct and there's no specific rule, moderator decisions stand. For disputes please [Message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/projectzomboid). Public appeals will result in an automatic ban. 

* 5: **Key-Selling Websites**: Please do not link to websites that sell keys to Project Zomboid. Not only are these usually illegitimate since The Indie Stone does not provide Steam keys to third party stores besides the Humble Bundle store, but their purchase does not support the developers.

* 6: **Art Posts**: All art that is not posted by the original creator must be sourced. We require the name or username of the original artist in the title of the submission.  
If you are posting your original art, we strongly encourage you to use [I Made] or [OC] in your title to avoid accidental removal. You may also include the artist's profile, social media, and/or website, in a top-level comment.  
All AI art posts are banned on the subreddit.

* 7: **Cross-Community Drama and Server Disputes**: Bans and disputes from other communities should be addressed to that community's moderators/admins. Ban/Dispute drama will be removed.

* 8: **Video Frequency**: One video may be posted every 24 hours and a maximum of three videos be posted every 7 days. Livestreams are the exception to this. They can be posted when you go live, so long as they involve PZ

* 9: **No Politics**: A game subreddit isn't really a suitable place for political discussion. This rule includes religion as well. These discussions often result in heated arguments and rule breaking, and there are more appropriate places to have those conversations.  

* 10: **Reddit Meta**: There's no point going on about votes, up or down. It is simply the nature of Reddit and beyond anyone's control.  
Complaining about low-effort content in other's threads can result in warnings and/or temp bans. If you're concerned about these posts, only report them or DM the mod team.

* 11: **Meme saturation**: Low-quality posts, low-effort posts, and memes that are not immediately recognizable to be PZ related or submitted during peak times of a popular meme within the subreddit may be subject to removal.  
This rule is in place to prevent low-effort memes from overshadowing other user posts over a prolonged period of time.  
In addition to this, commonly posted memes or variations of common posts, for example, spotting a Sledgehammer or Generator IRL, are also subject to removal.

* 12: **English Only**: All posts and comments must be in English. This rule ensures that the subreddit remains accessible and understandable to the majority of the community members. Any post or comment made in a language other than English will be removed.  
Commonly known phrases or terms from the game that are in another language are acceptable, provided that they are used within an otherwise English post or comment.

#About
###**Mission**

/r/Fantasy is the internet’s largest discussion forum for the greater Speculative Fiction genre. We welcome respectful dialogue related to speculative fiction in literature, games, film, and the wider world.

We reserve the right to remove discussion that does not fulfill the mission of /r/Fantasy.

###**Vision**

Build a reputation for inclusive, welcoming dialogue where creators and fans of all types of speculative fiction mingle.

###**Values**

*Respect for members and creators shall extend to every interaction.*

*Interact with the community in good faith.*

Interactions should not primarily be for personal benefit. Personal benefit includes, but is not limited to: financial gain from sales or referral links, traffic to your own website/blog/channel, karma farming, critiques or feedback of your work from the community, etc. This also applies to you posting on behalf of your friend/family member/neighbor.

#Rules
###**1. Be Kind**

Every interaction on the subreddit must be kind, respectful, and welcoming. Do not engage in hate speech, harassment, arguing in bad faith, [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning), or general pot stirring. This is an LGBTQ+ friendly space.

We ask all users help us create a welcoming environment by reporting posts/comments that do not follow the subreddit rules.

[See the wiki for the full text of this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/rules/#wiki_4._hide_spoilers)

###**5. No Pirated Content**

Any encouragement of piracy or links/instructions to visit pirating sites **will result in an immediate ban.**

[See the wiki for the full text of this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/rules/#wiki_7._articles.2C_blogs.2C_.26amp.3B_reviews)

###**8. Writing &amp; Publishing Discussion**

[See the wiki for the full text of this rule.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/rules/#wiki_8._writing_.26amp.3B_publishing_discussion)

###**9. Placeholder Rule for Reporting Purposes**

* For Rust questions, use the stickied Q&amp;A thread.

* Avoid re-treading topics that have been long-settled or utterly exhausted.

2025-10-19 15:05:13,625 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - subscribers 1068173
2025-10-19 15:05:13,625 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description **Guidelines**

**1 - True blunders only**

Simply being nerdy just isn’t going to cut it. If you wore your “nerd glasses because you thought you were so hipster,” that’s not enough of a blunder.

Halloween costumes do not count!

**2 - You must have a creative title.**

No "Puberty has been good to me." or "LOL I was random!" type titles. This is rule is entirely decided by the mods' discretion. 

**3 - Your blunder must have been at least 3 years ago**

No "still blundering"

**4 - Childhood photos are great, as long as they actually depict a blunder.**

Don't post a picture of yourself as a child just because you're dressed as a child, playing with your Furby, in a sandbox, etc. This isn't #ThrowbackThursday. If it's an actually embarrassing childhood photo though, then fantastic! 

**5 - It’s suggested that you provide a “now” picture, but you don't HAVE to.** 

Please post your updated picture as a comment on the original post. Separate posts that share an updated picture will be removed.

If the OP hasn't provided a "now" picture, it’s okay to request one, but *don't* push it: not everyone wants their current photo on Reddit. Do not go through the OPs post history and post one for them either.

**6 - Ask permission if there are other people in the photo**

Especially if someone else is the subject of the photo. This isn’t the place to get your blackmail on.

**7 - Be thoughtful when replying**

We have absolutely zero tolerance for:

* Blatant insults, racism, homo/transphobia, trolling, threats, or “you’re still blundering”-type comments.

* "10/10- would bang", "15 year old me would have wanted to be all over you" or "damn, you certainly developed nicely" -type comments

* Creepy compliments

* Certain subreddits are prohibited to linking to. Please see the banned words list.

Comments containing some specific words are automatically banned. [Here is a full list](https://www.reddit.com/r/blunderyears/wiki/banned_words).

Please report comments that violate this rule. Violations of this rule can and will result in an immediate ban!

**8 - No posting personal information**

This includes for yourself or other people, and refers to, but is not limited to, names, phone numbers, email addresses, facebook or other social media accounts.

**9 - Report content that breaks the rules**

We can't keep an eye on every single post and comment in the subreddit 24/7. Don't hesitate to contact the moderators for any reason.

**10 - All posts are subject to removal without notice at the mods' discretion if the post does not catch on.**

We strive to keep the quality of the posts at a high level and if your post does not catch on then it probably does not belong here in the first place.

**11 - No gatekeeping comments**

Please do not make comments regarding gatekeeping of any kind. Examples include but are not limited to: "No blunder here", "Read the rules this is not a blunder". The first offense will result in a one day ban as a warning and a second offense will result in a permanent ban.


That’s it! Have fun and laugh at each other, and yourself!

2025-10-19 15:05:13,637 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description This subreddit is devoted to the lovable idiots who do hilarious, idiot things in their idiot cars (or **trucks, motorcycles, tractors, or other vehicle**). We honor them with gifs, videos, images, and laughter.

##.:[Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsInCars/wiki/rules):.

&gt; **1** Suitable Content: Links to OC videos, gifs, and pictures only. No articles or stories please. No staged incidents. Links with death and/or gore in them don’t belong here. Try a partner subs if your content doesn’t follow this guideline. Partner subreddits are listed on the sidebar.

&gt; **2** Keep It Light: /r/IdiotsInCars is meant to be a lighthearted, humorous subreddit. If your post does not contribute to the nature of the sub it will be removed.

&gt; **3** Idiots Only: Posts must contain an obvious bad decision while in a vehicle, and does not need to result in a crash. Just because there is a car crash does not mean it belongs here.

&gt; **4** When in doubt, flag as NSFW: NSFW links need a NSFW tag. Use them generously. If someone might reasonably find your content NSFW, use the tag.

&gt; **5** No titles in ALL CAPS: This shouldn't even need to be said. It's just annoying.

&gt; **6** No circle-jerking or shit-posting: This includes "idiot in car starter kit" posts, "person I don't like in a vehicle" posts, and other shitposting.

&gt; **7** No bad parking jobs: We get it, people suck at parking.  That low effort fodder can go elsewhere.

&gt; **8** No reposts: This shouldn't be an issue since all content should be OC

&gt; **9** Moderators Have Final Say: For all situations covered and not covered by the above rules, moderators have final say and decisions are up to their discretion. If you have a question or problem, reach out to us via Mod Mail.

2025-10-19 15:05:13,641 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - subscribers 4890617
2025-10-19 15:05:13,641 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description ##Rules:

1. **Do not ask for help to enact some sort of petty revenge!  This includes telling a story and ending with "What would you have done?", "What are your thoughts?", "Any other ideas?"  All direct and indirect requests for ideas will result in a ban.**  This is literally your warning.

2. ***Stories*** should be **revenge**-based. **Karma =/= Revenge** Someone has wronged you, but you got your revenge, oh yes, you got your revenge. (If you have planned a revenge and need feedback, might I direct you to /r/myevilplan?)  Reporting someone to the an authority like the police is **not** revenge, it is simply just reporting someone to an authority.

3. No Politics.

4. "You" does not have to be you personally; posts relating to your friends, or good stories elsewhere on the internet, are fair game, as long as you're clear whose story it is.

5. ***Stories*** should be **petty**. I messed with their toothpaste. I turned their disk upside-down in their XBox. I *gasp* put shaving cream in their shoes. The more creative the better, (If you have a not so-petty revenge, post it in /r/prorevenge!)

6. ***Stories*** should **not** be serious. No: murder, rape, assault, grand theft (*petty* theft acceptable), or any other felonies.  **NO VANDALISM.**

7. ***Stories*** should be true. If a claim seems impossible or probably false, you will be asked for proof.

8. Racism, sexism, and other bigotry will not be tolerated, either in posts or in comments.

9. No identifying information (stay in compliance with [all Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq)).

10. NSFW posts should be labeled as such. NSFL posts probably aren't petty, but if you have a weird exception, label it appropriately.

11. No flame wars. Seriously, why do I have to specify this? Keep it classy, people!

12. No comments with the purpose of telling OP to x-post the post to another subreddit, **the comment will be removed**, send him/her a PM instead.  (This includes comments and/or statements similar to "This is borderline &lt;blank&gt;", "/r/&lt;blank&gt;", or "If you would've &lt;blank&gt; it would've been &lt;blank&gt;", or "/r/&lt;blank&gt; would love this")


Or have a malicious story with or without revenge? post it in /r/badpeoplestories!

All posts not in compliance with the rules will be removed. Posts that are resubmitted without asking permission will result in a ban.

Sometimes posts get lost just send a modmail do not send a PM directly.

Please link to the source whenever possible.

###Subreddit Rules 

*[Click for the subreddit's alternate rule list](/r/politicalhumor/about/rules)*


1. **Posts should be regarding U.S. politics.** 

     In other terms, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly. 

     Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, leftists, etc!), but please keep posts civil. 

2. **Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.** 

 **Make an effort with your title:** Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.

 If it's isn't funny (or at least trying to be), we'll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)

 If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. 

 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks, /r/politicaldebate or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a "flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.


3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** 

    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of SOME social media and satire websites are allowed. 

4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**

    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.

    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  

    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.

   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within "allowed" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.

  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. 

5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** 

 Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. 

 Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  

6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** 

  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. 

  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. 

  If you're a jerk, including use of "tard" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. 

  If you're intentionally trolling, including "google games," you will be banned. 

7. **Do not brigade.** 

  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. 

 ___7b.___  **No "Meta" Posts.**

 Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.


8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. 

9. **No pointing at offsite resources**

  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.

  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.

###Enforcement Policy 


* **Moderation actions are done at each moderator's own discretion.** 

* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. 

* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message and we'll take a look at why you were banned for you. Contrition will play in your favor if you were banned for violating our rules. 

* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)

2025-10-19 15:05:13,674 - reddit_crawler - DEBUG - description Some basic rules:

1. Please don't post here if you aren't yet 30 - we will be removing posts from people under 30. r/SkincareAddiction has a fantastic list of the other subs on Reddit where you will be talking to your peers: https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/related_subs

2. We can't (and don't) offer medical advice. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your health. Your post will be removed for asking about medical conditions (for example: a photo and "What is this?)

3. No spam, self-promotion, direct product links or consumer surveys! If you would like to recommend a product, you may link it within a text post. Also, do not self-promote your app, blog, you tube reviews, cosmetic services etc. Please don't use this group for surveys or consumer research.  If you are doing academic research and would like to ask for permission to post about your study, YOU MUST contact the moderation team before doing so.

4. Discussion of cosmetic surgeries / enhancements / treatments is totally cool here. 

5. Selfies are not allowed EXCEPT on Selfie Sundays.  If you are posting to ask questions about a particular area of your face, you must edit your photo so it is clear what you are concerned about, either by cropping the photo or by blocking out features you are NOT asking about.  

6. Be nice. Constructive criticism is cool, but acting like an ass is not. And do NOT post things like "How old do you think I look / am" as that never goes well. 

7. If you are shilling for a MLM company, you will be banned. Please see r/antiMLM if you want to know why.

8. [Wear sunscreen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI&amp;t=118)

We recommend checking out the [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction) over at /r/SkincareAddiction for a comprehensive list of skincare FAQs, tutorials, and their excellent [skincare Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index). The folks at ScA have put in a ton of time and effort into their resources, so take advantage of them!

#CONTENT POLICY

This subreddit is **moderated for quality**, which means we remove content that we deem to be low quality, low effort, nonsensical, or common/unoriginal. **We do not "let the votes decide"**. We understand that this type of policy is controversial and uncommon, especially for default subreddits, but we believe this method of moderation gives a subreddit the best chance at maintaining quality.

#[THE RULES](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/about/rules)

Rules are enforced upon moderator discretion. 

---

## 1: **IT MUST BE CRAPPY DESIGN**

**NOTE: All posts must be in English**

Every submission must be a bad design, otherwise it may be removed. Any design mentioned in this list of [things that are not crappy design](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/not_crappy_design) is not allowed. Other low-quality posts may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 2: **NO COMMON REPOSTS**

New content is encouraged. Reposts of content in the [common reposts list](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/wiki/common_reposts), in the [top 150 posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrappyDesign/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all) or under three months old are not allowed. Because of spam, no clothing of any kind.**Especially t-shirts.** Other reposts may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 3: **NO SOFTWARE DESIGNS**

Any kind of software design, intentional or not, is not allowed. This includes (but is not limited to): websites, emails, search results, videogames, etc. r/SoftwareGore or r/TechNope might be better places for these posts.

## 4: **NO HATE SYMBOLS**

This includes (but is not limited to): things that look like swastikas, "KKK" acronyms, Nazi salutes, racism, political hate, etc.

r/AccidentalSwastika, r/Oopzi, and r/AccidentalRacism might be better places for these posts.

## 5: **NO SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE POSTS**

This includes (but is not limited to): things or words that look like penises, vaginas, scrotums, boobs, butt-plugs, dildos, etc.

r/MildlyPenis, r/MildlyVagina, r/MildlyBoobs, and r/MildlyButthole might be better places for these posts.

## 6: **TITLES SHOULD DESCRIBE AND REPRESENT THE CONTENT**

If the crappy design is not obvious in the photo, please describe it in the title. Low effort titles, sarcasm, StRaNgE CaPiTaLiZaTiOnS, and excessive emojis may be removed at moderator discretion.

## 7: **NO MEMES OR IMAGE MACROS**

The crappy design should be obvious from the photo or the title. Memes or [image macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro) are not necessary to describe it.

## 8: **BE CIVIL AND NO PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words, inappropriate behavior and comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed.

Posts or comments containing or seeking any identifying personal information (real or fake) will also be removed. This includes (but is not limited to): names, phone numbers, email addresses, and social media accounts, regardless if it is your own.

Violators may be banned without prior warning for breaking any of these rules.

**1. No low effort posts.** Share investment ideas and insights or ask thoughtful investing discussion questions. We are not a politics or general corporate news forum. We generally expect that your topic incites responses relating to investing. Any post that contains large amounts of Gen AI text is considered low-effort.  

**2. Do not make posts looking for advice about your personal situation.**
If your question likely has a "right answer", a beginner topic, you simply need help finding general investing information, or if it's asking for general input on what to do with your investments then post in the "[Daily Advice and Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sticky?num=1)".

**3. Keep discussions civil, informative and polite.**
Off topic comments, attacks or insults will not be tolerated. We recognize that this forum will generate differences of opinion, or misunderstandings of facts, and therefore arguments are expected. However, personal attacks, insults, trolling, or accounts dedicated to getting under the skin of others is not allowed, and will be banned.

**4. Strictly no (self-)promotion or solicitation threads.**
Violating this rule results in an automatic permanent ban. Do not post your youtube, twitter, discord, app, tool, blog, referral code, event, survey, etc. We generally expect that people who come here are not using the forum to build a brand, generate clicks, or shill. Posts that are strictly self-interested or intended to "build awareness" are not acceptable.


**5 General corporate news and political posts** must follow these [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules#wiki_5._general_corporate_news_and_political_posts_guidelines). Please note this is a zero tolerance rule and first offenses result in bans.  

**6. Effort: Posts must meet standards of effort.** Do not post just an article, highlight the parts of the article you find relevant or offer some commentary surrounding the article. 
Additionally do not just make a self post to offer some simple thoughts. "now is the time to buy", "here's my thoughts", etc. belong as comments to existing posts. Making your own post devoid of in depth examination will likely result in it being removed. There is a 250 character requirement for posts.  

**7. Original Sourcing: articles posted must be from the original source on a best efforts basis.** This means if CNBC is reporting on something WSJ reported on we expect you to post the original article. If anyone is writing an article based on a Bank/investment group news release/white paper post the actual paper and not journalism surrounding it.  
Provide the link to the source article or paper.

A subreddit committed to intelligent understanding of the hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence progresses to the point of greater-than-human intelligence, radically changing civilization. This community studies the creation of superintelligence— and predict it will happen in the near future, and that ultimately, deliberate action ought to be taken to ensure that the Singularity benefits humanity.

#####On the Technological Singularity
The technological singularity, or simply the singularity, is a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be difficult for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is often seen as an occurrence (akin to a gravitational singularity) beyond which the future course of human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable.

The first use of the term "singularity" in this context was by mathematician John von Neumann. The term was popularized by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, who argues that artificial intelligence, human biological enhancement, or brain-computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 whereas Vinge predicts some time before 2030.

Proponents of the singularity typically postulate an "intelligence explosion", where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful minds, that might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive abilities greatly surpass that of any human.

A subreddit for the lore and stories encompassing the dark future of the 41st millennium. Get a full context of what that means [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/v4b2li/welcome_to_uthebladesaurus_introduction_to/)

# Set your 40kLore flair
Set your 40kLore flair via the wondrous [Flair Selection Page](https://jonnynoog.github.io/r40kLore/). Failure to do so may result in investigation by the Inquisition. You have been warned.

## Subreddit Rules

* Rule 1: Be respectful. Hate speech, trolling, and aggressive behavior will not be tolerated, and may result in a ban.
* Rule 2: No soliciting. Please don't use this as a platform to promote your blog, crowdfunding, or anything of the ilk. Posts featuring self-promotion will be removed.
* Rule 3: Please use SPOILER tags when necessary. To add a spoiler to one of your comments, simply wrap it in exclamation marks and arrows `&gt;!!&lt;`. E.g: `&gt;!Spoilers go here!&lt;`;This is the result: &gt;!Spoilers go here!&lt;. Also, no spoilers in post titles.
* Rule 4: No Memes, shitposts, or low-effort posts/comments. Leave those in /r/Grimdank. This includes "who would win" and broad "what if" scenarios. This also includes text blocks consisting of Ork-speak, which should be posted at /r/40kOrkScience instead.
* Rule 4b: Do not post just links (YouTube, Imgur, Bell of Lost Souls, etc). While these are allowed in specific cases, you must also provide a summary of the work, a specific reason you are posting, and credit to the original creator.
* Rule 4c: All hypothetical question posts must make an effort to answer the question. Do your best to provide lore-based reasoning behind your answer.
* Rule 5: This subreddit is for discussion of 40k lore only. Please do not post/discuss rules or tactics of the tabletop, painting, building, or miniatures. There are other subreddits for that. Please also do not post/discuss things that are generally off-topic to 40k lore.
* Rule 6: No opinion-based, real-world politics. Full stop. Pointing out or analyzing the political references, satire, and allegories in the lore is okay, provided it is in an objective, academic manor. Making judgement or directing your posts/comments at individual users is not a good faith effort. Such posts/comments will be removed and bans may apply. No mentions of 'woke' or 'forced inclusivity' or dog whistling, et al.
* Rule 7: Official lore and fan fiction/fluff are welcome, but posting screenshots of official Games Workshop and/or Black Library material is not allowed. You may transcribe the text, however, and we request that you cite the book it came from. Fan fiction must be labeled, such as using [F] to denote such a post.
* Rule 8: Posts containing novel excerpts must be supported by at least a paragraph describing why this moment is important, be it a grand revelation in the lore or a critical turning point in a character design. Excerpts must also be a "reasonable length", page long direct copies are not permitted. If you can't get to the point in a few paragraphs, it might not be worth posting.
* Rule 9: No excerpts from a novel (novellas/short stories excluded) released within the last 30 days, so that there is time for others to read it. Discussion threads/comments are welcome but must be appropriately marked with spoiler tags and have no revealing information in the post title.
* Rule 10: Certain topics are considered too controversial and tend to always end in arguments, rule-breaking, and reports. Please review [the short conversation blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/wiki/index/rules#wiki_rule_10.3A_mind_the_conversation_blacklist) on our wiki before commenting or posting.

**[Rules](/r/factorio/about/rules)**
***


1. **All content must be related to Factorio**  
  This is a subreddit for the game Factorio. If you want to post about other things, there are subreddits for that. Every post must be about Factorio or of content you have made that is directly inspired by Factorio (such as fan art).

2. **All posts must be in English**

3. **No political content**

4. **Be nice**  
  Think about how your words affect others before saying them.

5. **Explain your screenshots**  
  [Take a screenshot](https://screenshot.help) (or a [video](https://obsproject.com/)), not a picture/recording with your phone.

  When posting a screenshot, add a comment explaining your image or pointing out what you want people to look at.

  Tips for making your screenshot better: When taking screenshots of a design, turn on `alt` mode, inserter arrows, and well lit in daytime or with lamps. When posting a rail design, hold a signal in your hand. When asking for help, avoid cropping screenshots.

6. **No memes, low effort posts, or image macros**  
  Post these to /r/Factoriohno instead.

7. **Don't come here only to plug your content**  
  Reddit is a place for discussion, not advertising. Here are some [reddit-wide guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) for self-promotion. Generally, be a part of the community you are posting in. People are likely to be more interested in your content that way.  
  
  If you're a video creator, you may only post your Let's Play or streams once per month. We feel this is a good balance to keep the subreddit from becoming just an advertising platform.

8. **No topics voted out by the community**  
  Posts of the following have become too common and will be removed:  
  * Pictures of where you are playing Factorio.
  * Pictures of IRL things that remind you of Factorio.
  * Minor graphical glitches.
  * Inescapable spawns.  
  * Achievements and end screens are allowed but you **MUST PROVIDE CONTEXT**  
  * "OMG this game is so addicting" (without providing additional (in-game) context).  
  
  This list was last updated on [the 6th of February 2023](/10vnp4a).

9. No advertising unofficial merch without prior permission. [See](/lk94g6)

Submit bug reports on [the official forum](https://forums.factorio.com/viewforum.php?f=7).

**Words of wisdom by /u/talrich**

*Namaste. You seek balance. Here is my wisdom. Your mistakes have no cost but time, and the deconstruction planner even reduces that cost. Most games punish you for building, demolishing and rebuilding. Not Factorio. Let your anxiety wash away as you perceive that every belt placed can be moved. Every assembler is but a visitor to where it resides. The only significance is life, which leads to the further wisdom. Look both ways before you cross the tracks.*
